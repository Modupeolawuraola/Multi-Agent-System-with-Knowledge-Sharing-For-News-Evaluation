Navarro, who has a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is widely considered the “architect” of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs unveiled last week at the White House, according to Reuters.

Despite also having a senior role in the Trump administration, Musk unleashed his opinions in a Saturday reply to an X clip of Navarro explaining that the president wants to charge other countries “what they charge us.”

“A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” the tech mogul wrote. “Results in the ego/brains>>1 problem.”

In another comment that has since been deleted, Musk said, “He ain’t built sh*t,” referring to Navarro.

The billionaire’s response came after Tesla stock plummeted following the tariffs announcement, Newsweek reported.

Musk also replied affirmatively to a quote attributed to renowned economist Thomas Sowell on “a man from Harvard” being in the middle of “every disaster throughout American history,” though the source of the quote is unclear.

“Yup,” the DOGE leader responded.

Navarro took to CNBC on Monday to address Musk’s comments, calling him a “car assembler” who wants to keep his costs down.

Look, Elon Musk and his DOGE team is making contributions to America in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse. And that’s a very good thing for this country and the American people. […] But he’s not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler, in many cases. If you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets — which, in the EV case — is the batteries come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan… What we want, and the difference is in our thinking and Elon’s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here. This business model where BMW and Mercedes come in to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security.

“And with Elon, it’s fine. He’s a car man — he’s a car person. That’s what he does. And he wants the cheap foreign parts. And we understand that,” Navarro added. He noted that the rift between himself and Musk is “no big deal” and that the pair would likely see each other at the White House later that day.

Trump had not made a public comment on the spat at the time of writing.

The Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.

The unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act’s use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.

The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing, partially dissented.

Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, writing in all-caps that it was “a great day for justice in America.”

”The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,” he wrote.

Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly applauded the decision, with Bondi describing it as a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”

“An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,” the attorney general posted on social media.

“President Trump was proven RIGHT once again!” Noem posted, adding, “LEAVE NOW or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.”

Trump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg’s order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected — in other words, anyone else. By granting the president’s request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg’s orders.

Critically, the court made clear in its unsigned order that officials must give migrants subject to Trump’s proclamation adequate notice that they are being removed pursuant to the wartime authority so they have “reasonable time” to bring habeas complaints. Those are suits brought by people who claim they are being detained by the government unlawfully.

A key concern among attorneys representing the migrants has been that the government’s rush to remove migrants under the act leaves them with little to no time to file such legal claims.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s most senior liberal, argued the Trump administration’s conduct in the case “poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”

“That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible,” she wrote. “We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this.” Barrett, though she did not write separately, joined a key portion of Sotomayor’s dissent questioning whether habeas claims should be the exclusive way for people to challenge their deportations under the act.

The court’s order comes a day before Boasberg was set to hear arguments over whether to indefinitely block Trump’s use of the wartime authority for the deportations. The judge is separately weighing whether “probable cause” exists to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for violating his orders when it allowed deportation flights to continue last month. Trump and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Boasberg as exceeding his authority, earning the president a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.

In her searing dissent, Sotomayor said the compliance issue before Boasberg “should be reason enough to doubt that the government appears before this court with clean hands.”

“That is all the more true because the government has persistently stonewalled the District Court’s efforts to find out whether the government in fact flouted its express order,” she wrote, later adding that the administration’s “conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”

In a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson blasted the majority for ruling on the case using the emergency docket, without oral arguments or a more considered briefing. Jackson referenced the 1944 Korematsu case, in which the Supreme Court infamously allowed for the internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.

“I lament that the court appears to have embarked on a new era of procedural variability, and that it has done so in such a casual, inequitable, and, in my view, inappropriate manner,” Jackson wrote.

“At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,” she wrote.

Trump’s invocation of the centuries-old law

At issue was Trump’s invocation on March 15 of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives a president broad power to target and remove undocumented immigrants in times of war or when an enemy attempts an “invasion or predatory incursion.” Trump has argued the flow of alleged gang members from Venezuela constitutes an invasion.

Soon after Trump invoked the law, officials loaded up three planes with more than 200 Venezuelan nationals and flew them to El Salvador, where they are being housed in a maximum-security mega prison. The administration has since said that some of those people were deported under authorities other than the 18th century act.

The Trump administration has said the men were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

But there have been growing questions about how those determinations were made. The court was considering the appeal amid revelations the administration mistakenly deported a Maryland father to El Salvador “because of an administrative error.” The deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia took place under a different legal authority — not the Alien Enemies Act — but it underscored the potential risks involved with the rapid deportations.

Earlier Monday, the Supreme Court placed on hold a lower court order requiring the government to return Abrego Garcia to the US by midnight.

Boasberg’s order halting additional removals didn’t block the administration from deporting alleged gang members under other laws, nor did it stop the administration from apprehending immigrants under the act. Trump nevertheless quickly appealed.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 on March 26 that Boasberg’s orders could stand while the legal challenge plays out. The majority included one judge nominated by President George H.W. Bush and another by President Barack Obama.

US Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote that the term “invasion” was widely understood among the nation’s founders as involving a military invasion.

“The phrase echoes throughout the Constitution ratified by the people just nine years before. And in every instance, it is used in a military sense,” she wrote.

But the second time around, the protests surrounding Trump’s inauguration were comparably muted — they were a fraction of the size, and generated far less impact than the first round. The disparity seemed to capture the demoralized, depleted mood among Americans who opposed Trump and stared slack-jawed as he won the popular vote upon his third attempt at the White House.

Yet on Saturday, mass protests swept the nation, and it could mean that dissenting Americans are finding their voices again. At a time when Trump is moving aggressively to crack down on intellectual and political dissent at universities, last weekend’s protests represented a massive rebuke of the Trump administration — and suggested the left is regaining its footing, as it figures out how to fight back.

Registering dissent is an important democratic exercise.

Saturday’s “Hands Off!” rallies were backed by a large coalition of organizations that included civil rights groups, labor unions, climate groups, progressive activist outfits and left-wing groups like the Democratic Socialists of America. The organizers put forth three demands: “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration”; “an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on”; and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”

The turnout was big: Over 1,000 “Hands Off” protests were planned across all 50 states, and organizers said turnout far exceeded the turnout of 500,000 RSVPs. There aren’t any independent estimates of national turnout, but dense, large crowds made their presence known in many cities. Per The New York Times:

On Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the protest stretched for nearly 20 blocks. In Chicago, thousands flooded Daley Plaza and adjacent streets, while, in the nation’s capital, tens of thousands surrounded the Washington Monument. In Atlanta, the police estimated the crowd marching to the gold-domed statehouse at over 20,000.

In addition to the crowds of thousands — or tens of thousands — who showed up in cities and towns across the nation, protests also took place abroad in cities including London, Paris and Berlin.

Like all mass protests, the messages conveyed at these ones were diverse and sprawled beyond the overarching themes of the organizers. Protest signs expressed concern about free speech at a time when Trump is trying to quash it by bullying universities and attempting to deport legal immigrants who express pro-Palestinian speech. There were objections to Trump’s global economy-destabilizing tariff regime. In Washington, D.C., a rally for Gaza, in which protesters marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, took place adjacent to the main “Hands Off” rally. And a lot of signs framed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk as posing a fascist threat to the country.

The broad scope of the protests mirrors the broad scope of Trump’s assault on our republic — and underscores how big of a tent the anti-Trump coalition is going to need to be to effectively resist Trump’s dismantling of the administrative state, social services and democratic institutions.

To be sure, though it’s been on a smaller scale and less noticed, there actually has been a lot of protest activity in the first few months of Trump’s second administration. Indivisible, a liberal grassroots network, was effective in encouraging outraged citizens to go to town halls to make noise and hold Republicans accountable — so much so that the National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP lawmakers to stop attending town halls rather than face their constituents’ wrath. Musk’s Tesla has been the object of boycotts and protests that appear to be hurting its bottom line. Anti-DOGE protests have taken place across the country for months. And while the Democratic Party leadership has largely shown itself to be feckless and is increasingly losing the trust of its members, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been drawing huge crowds in swing states across the U.S. with his “Fighting Oligarchy” Tour.

It can be easy to overestimate the significance of a single protest, even a huge one. One-off protests can be forgotten rather quickly in an era where the news cycle moves at an unfathomable speed. And it’s relatively easy to get people to object to something; it’s far harder to get them to organize around a widely desired alternative.

Still, registering dissent is an important democratic exercise, and reports of older first-time protesters coming out to say “no” to Trump are positive signs. As the republic teeters on the edge of myriad crises, the left is exhausted and afraid. But on Saturday it reminded us it’s still here, and it’s not going to go quietly into the night.",Left

Trump digs in on tariffs amid another volatile day for the stock market

President Donald Trump pressed forward with aggressive tariffs that have roiled the global economy as he faced pushback from Wall Street, world leaders and some members of his own party.

Here’s the latest on where the trade war stands:

Trump plows ahead: Trump said he is “not looking” to pause his tariffs before they go into effect Wednesday.

“We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,” Trump said. “They’re going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs.”

Asked whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation — a point his advisers struggled to clarify last week — Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”

“There could be permanent, and there could also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said. “So we’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.”

Stock market volatility: The markets ended largely lower Monday after a wild trading day. The S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.

U.S. markets whipsawed as investors grasped for any shred of news that indicated Trump would relent on his tariffs plan. A widely circulated but false headline saying he was considering a 90-day pause sent markets skyrocketing for a brief time.

New threat over China: Trump threatened additional tariffs of 50% on China if it doesn’t rescind its retaliatory measures of 34%. That’s in addition to his announcement last week, meaning the total tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China would be as much as 104% if they were fully implemented.

Talks with Japan: Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba “was sending a top team to negotiate” after the two leaders spoke over the phone.

Calling Trump’s 24% tariff on Japanese goods “extremely unfortunate,” Ishiba — whose country is the single largest foreign investor in the United States — said he told Trump during their 25-minute call that he was “deeply concerned that these American tariff measures will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.”

The view from Wall Street: Major figures in the business world have spent the last few days sounding the alarm about the economic consequences of Trump’s tariff policies, with some even reversing their previous supportive stances of him.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%.

Dimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.”

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on X that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team.

“This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign.

The view from Capitol Hill: Republicans in Congress are still largely sticking by Trump through the tariff turbulence, though new cracks have continued to emerge.

A bipartisan Senate bill that would limit the president’s power to impose tariffs now has seven Republican co-sponsors. But the White House officially said Trump would veto the legislation if it reached his desk, meaning it would take two-thirds of the GOP-controlled House and Senate to turn it into law. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said of the bill: “I don’t think that has a future.”

Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah posted on X in favor of Trump’s taking up the European Union on its offer of zero-for-zero tariffs.

Over in the House, some anxious Republicans are seeking more guidance about Trump’s broader plans. During a House GOP conference call over the weekend, Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, asked whether lawmakers could get a detailed briefing from the White House about Trump’s tariffs. And Rep. French Hill, of Arkansas, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, expressed some frustration with how the White House has handled the tariff situation.

Still, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress would give Trump “the space necessary” to handle tariffs.

As global markets continue to melt down in reaction to the president’s tariff program and his manifest willingness to wage a trade war, the question of the day is whether these adverse signals of real-world economic consequences will restrain him. To answer that question with another: Why would anyone imagine such a thing?

By now, it should be universally understood that the second Trump administration is based on sweeping away absolutely any limitation on presidential power. Trump has created a Cabinet in which demonstrating loyalty to the president is the only real criterion. He has demanded and received the most craven submission to his every whim from the two men who run Congress, Mike Johnson and John Thune. This includes surrendering long-established congressional authority over tariffs, spending, and statutory guidance of federal agencies.

The two men with whom Trump has shared his completely unprecedented executive authority are each deeply committed to the fullest exercise imaginable of arbitrary power. Russell Vought has what can only be described as a religious belief in the necessity of destroying even the smallest reservoir of non-MAGA thinking anywhere in the federal bureaucracy. Elon Musk may not be religious, but has made it clear he thinks civilization itself requires the utter demolition of the governmental status quo ante. Neither Vought nor Musk has any authority that is not derived from Trump’s own limitless concept of his place in the constitutional scheme.

And all this vast concentration of power is invested in a 78-year-old man full of grievances and resentments who knows his time on top of the world is limited by nature if not by law. There is absolutely no reason to think he cares about polls or special elections anymore, and if he can get his “big, beautiful” budget-reconciliation bill through the legislature later this year, he has little to fear from the 2026 midterm elections either. Yes, federal judges continue to pester Trump and his appointees here and there, but there he still has reason to hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will ratify his most important power grabs.

So there’s no particular reason to think that all the flashing red lights and sirens going off right now are going to influence Trump’s conduct. And indeed, there’s lots of evidence they won’t. Markets rallied magnificently on Monday morning when a false report emerged on social media that Trump was considering a 90-day “pause” on all the freshly imposed tariffs (other than those affecting China). Then the White House hastened to denounce that report as “fake news.” It’s as though Trump wanted to signal to markets: “Please resume your panic-stricken collapse.”

What this reaction clearly indicated was that the White House feared any perception that a change of direction was in the offing, so much that it was willing — even determined — to repudiate a positive market trend that meant trillions of dollars to large and small investors. On the topic of tariffs, at least, it’s time for stereotypes about the highly erratic man in the Oval Office to give way to the reality of a president wedded to bad economic policies for deeply personal reasons, as Bloomberg Opinion’s Timothy O’Brien pointed out:

Anyone hoping that Trump will soon see the light and reverse course might want to reconsider the force of nature that they’re dealing with. …

His primary aim is to address his grievances with the world, not to craft substantive or even rational public policy. An inordinate number of his goals involve self-aggrandizement or self-preservation. Many others are performative and unhinged. A meaningful number of his ambitions involve seeking revenge on people, institutions, and organizations that he believes have taken advantage of him, the country or his supporters. He has a long history of labeling America’s trading partners, some of whom are the US’s closest allies, as pickpockets and he’s now in a position to do something about it.

There’s no reason to think Trump will let Wall Street or “economics experts” or even the looming possibility of a recession turn him around. Regardless of what happens to the economy, he may have all the political power he needs to do what he wants, until he’s past the point of needing anyone’s approval or support. And that lack of limits on his power is what makes him so dangerous.",Left

The Trump administration is in the early stages of planning for a military parade to take place in Washington, DC, in June to commemorate the Army’s 250th anniversary, two defense officials told CNN on Monday.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday also confirmed that the city is having discussions with the administration about it, a day after the Washington City Paper reported on the plans for a military parade to be held on June 14. That date is both the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.

Preliminary plans call for the parade to stretch from the Pentagon in Arlington to the White House, defense officials told CNN.

Asked about the parade on Monday, Bowser told reporters that the administration had reached out to DC city officials recently to discuss the idea.

“I haven’t been directly involved in it yet,” she said. “I understand that – I think it was Homeland Security, maybe the White House – reached out to our special events task force, which is what most people wanting to do a parade do in the district. So, I would say it’s at its early stages. Yes, they have reached out. I don’t know if it’s being characterized as a military parade.”

A defense official told CNN on Monday that plans for a big celebration for the Army’s 250th birthday have been under consideration for roughly a year and began before the election in November.

But the idea of adding a parade to the celebration came up more recently in conversations between the Army and the White House, which has been leading on the parade effort and planning in recent weeks, another defense official said. Trump has not yet signed off on final plans for the parade, however, the officials said.

Army spokesperson Col. Dave Butler told CNN that “any discussion of the parade is pre-decisional at this point. We are intending to have a national level celebration to help build pride in America’s army and increase pride in America.”

Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the officials said the Army has been looking over options to make its annual celebration far bigger, with more capability demonstrations, static displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.

The event will likely involve the Army’s demonstration parachute team, the Golden Knights, armored Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, the officials said, though it would likely not include M-1 Abrams tanks due to their size and weight.

Bowser on Monday expressed concern over the possibility that tanks could damage DC streets, but one of the defense officials emphasized that the Army is working in coordination with civil engineers to ensure there is no damage to roadways if there is a parade.

The parade planning harkens back to Trump’s first term, when he hoped to host a military-style parade but called it off after the city said it would cost tens of millions of dollars, CNN previously reported. It is not clear how much the parade is estimated to cost this time around.

A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a question asking for more details about the administration’s coordination with the city to plan a parade. CNN has reached out to the White House and DHS for comment.

Arlington County Chair Takis Karantonis said in a statement on Monday that the county was contacted by the Secret Service on Friday “regarding the possibility of a military parade to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, but no further details were offered.”

The county, which is home to the Pentagon and many active and retired military personnel, has not received a formal request from the federal government for any assistance for the parade, he added.

“At this time, it is not clear to me what the scope of the parade would … be,” Karantonis said, “but I would hope the Federal Government remains sensitive to the pain and concerns of numerous active military and veteran residents, who have lost or might lose their jobs in recent federal decisions, as they reflect on how best to celebrate the Army’s anniversary.”",Left

Last week, Donald Trump showed us, once again, just how much damage his administration and its misguided policies could inflict on the American people. But there’s also a hopeful lesson we can take from the last few days: People are fighting back. I’d even venture to say that last week was the best political week Democrats, and anyone else horrified by the Trump administration, have had since Election Day.

Across the country, it’s the people who are driving this huge energy shift. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Americans poured into the streets in communities big and small to protest against Trump. While cities like New York and Washington, D.C., saw tens of thousands, and big crowds showed up in red areas, too.

I’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.

The American people are also making themselves heard at the ballot box. On Tuesday, the people of Wisconsin delivered a complete rebuke to Elon Musk as he attempted to buy a state Supreme Court seat. The world’s richest man went so far as to travel there to campaign with oversized checks and cheesehead hats. Voters responded by electing a liberal judge by a double-digit margin over the MAGA favorite. In Florida, the outpouring of anti-Trump and anti-Musk energy shaved roughly 15 to 20 points off Republicans’ November margins in two special elections for Congress. These are all good signs.

People are also responding by throwing their hat in the ring to run for higher office. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra launched a bid for California governor; Garlin Gilchrist, Michigan’s lieutenant governor, entered the gubernatorial race; and Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator, jumped into a race for an open U.S. Senate seat.

Democrats in Washington are also showing some signs of life. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, breaking the record of segregationist Strom Thurmond and reminding Americans that someone is standing up for them.

Clearly a lot of people were hungry for somebody in Washington to take that kind of action. On Booker’s TikTok account alone, the livestream of his speech got over 350 million likes and 110,000 people watched the senator finish his remarks on his YouTube page. In the end, Booker’s speech sparked more attention and coverage than anything else Democrats in Washington have tried since Trump took office.

Other Senate Democrats joined the fight, too. Sen. Adam Schiff of California placed a hold on the nomination of Ed Martin to be the top prosecutor in Washington, D.C. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona pledged to do the same to block Trump’s nominees for top leaders at the Department of Veterans Affairs, in protest of the president’s plans to slash jobs and jeopardize benefits at the agency. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington spearheaded a bipartisan push to have Congress take away Trump’s power to implement tariffs. And Senate Democrats convinced a handful of Republicans to join them in voting to suspend tariffs on Canada.

I’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.

Last week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it.

Also last week, some of the biggest names in Democratic politics stepped back into the fray. Former President Barack Obama spoke to a crowd at Hamilton College in upstate New York on Thursday, calling out just how outrageous the last few months have been. “Imagine if I had done any of this,” Obama told the crowd. “It’s unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me, or a whole bunch of my predecessors.”

Former Vice President Kamala Harris made a rare public appearance, also calling out organizations that aren’t meeting the moment: “There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country, and I understand it, but we’re seeing people stay quiet. We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.”

Last week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it. So, while there are plenty of reasons to fear the actions of the Trump administration, it’s important to note that people are standing up to it. People are making their elected officials listen. There is a lot of work ahead, but these are all steps in the right direction.

As Booker wrote on social media after his marathon speech, “After getting some rest, I am in awe of everyone who continues to lift their voice and speak out. This is a moment for our country, and we must make a choice about the America we want to be.”",Left

Members of BookTok, TikTok’s passionate community of readers, have expressed dismay at the possibility of book prices increasing, as well as the news that some international booksellers were re-evaluating their policies on selling to the United States.

“This has gotten so far beyond out of hand, and the book industry is a small industry in the greater world,” said TikTok creator Lia Reads, whose video on how tariffs will affect the book industry has been viewed more than 600,000 times.

Over the past few days, dozens of others within the BookTok community have posted similar videos sounding the alarm over tariffs, with several people referencing a different creator’s November 2024 video in which she had suggested that Trump’s re-election would mean the return of $10 paperbacks.

Print books and children’s picture books currently feature on a list of exempted products released by the White House on April 2 alongside Trump’s executive order, meaning that items such as Bibles printed on thin paper and baby board books, the majority of which are printed abroad, may not be affected.

But new tariffs could increase the cost of manufacturing books, in turn narrowing publishers’ profit margins and, ultimately, raising the price at the cash register, according to Brian O’Leary, executive director of the Book Industry Study Group, a U.S. trade organization that includes some of the largest book publishers.

Most books sold in the United States are printed domestically, but the necessary raw materials are still imported, as well as machine parts needed to maintain the printing equipment itself. In 2023, the United States imported more than $409 million worth of paper, much of which is used for printing books. As much as 73% of that came from Canada.

“Taken as a whole, these additional duties may increase costs in the short term, as the price of consumables rise,” O’Leary said in an email. “In the longer term, tariffs may also affect the cost of domestic manufacturing, if presses become more expensive to purchase and maintain.”

There is also some confusion around how tariffs would affect Americans’ ability to buy books sold abroad. Some U.S. readers prefer to buy their favorite titles from foreign retailers due to the pull of earlier release dates, exclusive content and collectible different editions.

“Waterstones, if you see this, can you please make sure I get my signed copy of Katabasis in September please?” one BookTok member said, referring to the United Kingdom-based bookstore and the upcoming novel by bestselling author R.F. Kuang. “I’ll pay the extra money, I don’t care.”

In an Instagram post Saturday promoting a different new release, Waterstones clarified that “Customers in the USA are able to order from us whilst we work on the implications of new tariffs. Any future charges will be indicated at checkout.”

Responding to a comment below the post asking, “If I already pre ordered (about 2 months ago) do I have anything to worry about?” Waterstones replied, “I mean there’s plenty to worry about, in the world, but your order will be fine.”

The retailer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The BookTok community’s concern over tariffs comes as its members continue to debate whether books should be separate from politics. In the months leading up to the election, some creators pushed for a “politics-free” BookTok. Others, including best-selling author Jodi Picoult, have argued that books are inherently political, citing the recent book bans.

Many readers who lamented the potential impact of tariffs simultaneously expressed concerns that authors may be less likely to travel for book tours as some U.S. residents and visitors report being detained at U.S. borders and some countries warn against travel.

Romance novelist Ali Hazelwood, who is originally from Italy and resides in the United States, said she’s canceling her U.K. tour and opting for virtual events instead, writing in a post on Instagram: “This is because of several complicated reasons that mostly boil down to the fact that, things being what they are, it’s not possible for me to safely travel outside and then back inside the US.”

A representative from Penguin Random House, Hazelwood's U.S. publisher, declined to comment, saying via email that Hazelwood did not want to speak to the media about the issue.

“Do you all remember back during the election, when there was this huge hubbub all over Bookstagram, all over BookTok, about how we shouldn’t talk about politics? That books aren’t supposed to be political?” BookTok creator Cait, known as Beneath the Covers NYC on the platform, said in a video mentioning tariffs. “Well, you might want to rethink that.”",Lean Left

Kennedy Jr., secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), speaks during a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2025. Photo: Jason C. Andrew/Bloomberg/Getty Images

In February, Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to downplay the seriousness of an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas after an unvaccinated child became the first person to die from the virus in the United States since 2015.

“There’ve been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year, there were 16. So it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at the time.

Kennedy, a prominent, longtime anti-vaccine activist, changed course somewhat over the weekend. In an X post after a second child died from the Texas outbreak, the secretary expressed public support for the measles vaccine. But hours later, he praised two “healers,” making dubious claims about them treating 300 children with measles.

On Sunday, Kennedy attended the funeral of 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand, who passed away on Thursday. According to Texas officials, Hildebrand was unvaccinated, had no underlying health conditions, and died of “measles pulmonary failure.” The Health secretary spoke to the child’s family, per the New York Times, but he did not speak at the ceremony or make a public statement during his visit.

In a social-media post, Kennedy confirmed that he traveled to Gaines County, Texas, to “comfort” Hildebrand’s family, noting that he had also become close with the relatives of Kayley Fehr, the 6-year-old who died from measles in Texas in February. (The death of an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico has also been tied to the outbreak.)

“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he wrote.

Buried in his statement was a brief acknowledgment of the measles vaccine and its efficacy in preventing the disease. “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” Kennedy said.

This was a marked difference from the positions that Kennedy had taken publicly since being confirmed as HHS secretary. In a Fox News editorial published early last month, Kennedy outlined the health risks that the measles pose to communities, but notably stopped short of advocating directly for Americans to get vaccinated for the disease, calling the decision to vaccinate “a personal one.” Instead, the secretary advised readers to eat better. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses. Vitamins A, C, and D, and foods rich in vitamins B12, C, and E should be part of a balanced diet,” Kennedy wrote.

A week later, Kennedy spoke with Fox News’ Sean Hannity and played up the alleged negative effects of the measles vaccine, once again advising Americans to make their own personal decision on vaccination. “There are adverse events from the vaccine,” Kennedy said. “It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes: encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”

And several hours after his Sunday social-media post, Kennedy was back to floating bogus information about measles treatments. The secretary posted three photos of himself with the families of the children who died of measles and wrote, “I also visited with these two extraordinary healers, Dr. Richard Bartlett and Dr. Ben Edwards who have treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.”

As Bloomberg explained, the drugs RFK Jr. mentioned are “a steroid treatment and an antibiotic,” and “neither has proved to treat measles, which is a virus and thus not susceptible to antibiotics”:

The data supporting alternative treatments for measles is scant, in part because the rarity of the disease makes it difficult to run controlled studies, said Marschall Runge, dean of the University of Michigan Medical School. In many cases, it’s impossible to tell whether a given medicine was effective or whether the patient simply had a mild case of the disease that cleared up on his own.

“What we do have is abundant evidence that there is no cure for measles,” Runge said.

Both doctors have promoted unproven treatments in the past. In 2003, Bartlett was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board over “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, according to CNN. Bartlett complied with the board’s requests and was cleared to return to practice two years later. As for Edwards, the New York Times reported:

The physician, Dr. Ben Edwards, is well known in the area for producing podcasts that often discuss the dangers of vaccines, and for his wellness clinic in Lubbock, which rejects central tenets of medicine, like the idea that germs cause certain diseases.

As of April 4, Texas has seen at least 481 reported cases of the measles, and the outbreak area has expanded to ten counties. Neighboring New Mexico has reported 54 cases since February.",Left

Last week, Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs, then suggested via an article shared to Truth Social that everyone should relax because he’s “purposely crashing the market.” Despite the president’s call to “HANK TOUGH” on Friday, everyone did the exact opposite over the weekend. Americans stressed about their shrinking 401(k)s and stocked up on big-ticket items like iPhones. As Asian markets plunged on Sunday night, the U.S. braced for a historic plunge.

So Trump turned to his favorite tactic: hurling nasty nicknames. In a series of Monday morning Truth Social posts, the president insisted that prices are down, he’s just fixing the mistakes of his predecessors, and “some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!” Then he dropped a new moniker for anyone who says otherwise:

A first, it seemed like Trump should have spent less time golfing this weekend and more time workshopping his latest idiotic nickname. “Panican” — probably a combination of “panic” and “Republican” — is not an obvious jab, as evidenced by the fact that Trump needed to explain the meaning. (“A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!”)

When the U.S. markets opened half an hour later, the news was grim, as expected. U.S. stocks tumbled for a third straight day and the S&P 500 entered bear market territory for the first time since 2022.

This is now the worst three-day performance for the S&P 500 since October 1987. — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) April 7, 2025

But suddenly, the markets swung up wildly. Trump successfully mocked the stock market into submission! Another widely derided Trumpian nickname worked, just like “Kamabla“!

Well, upon further investigation, the markets actually rallied in response to a rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China (this was widely attributed to X user “*Walter Bloomberg” but was also reported on CNBC and may have originally come from a Reuters bulletin):

And upon even further investigation, that is literally fake news. The speculation was based on a misinterpretation of comments top Trump adviser Kevin Hassett made in a Fox News interview. The White House quickly said reports of a 90-day pause on tariffs were untrue, and the markets continued their plunge:

INSANE market action right now. Market exploded higher on a headline attributed to Kevin Hassett. And now nobody can figure out where it came from and the markets are diving again.

The market losses Thursday and Friday were worse than 99.9% of all trading days since 1929, and Monday morning brought even further declines. This historical sell-off was without doubt the result of Trump’s big “Liberation Day,” when he revealed a set of tariffs that raises the average U.S. tax on imports to levels not seen in almost a century.

Tariffs of this magnitude pose an especially tough challenge for the economy. Because they are largely passed forward to consumers, they raise prices. And because they similarly raise the price of inputs for domestic producers — 45% of our imports are “intermediate goods” — they raise the cost of production, which hurts growth. Add to these woes the tremendous uncertainty created by Trump’s on-again, off-again policy lurching, along with the aforementioned market meltdown, and you understand a) why both consumer and investor sentiment has fallen off a cliff, and b) why economic forecasters have lowered their growth expectations and raised their inflation forecasts.

Faced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?

This combination of lower growth and faster inflation is called stagflation, and it is a particular challenge for the Federal Reserve. To counteract slower growth, Fed officials can lower the benchmark interest rate they control. But to counteract inflationary pressures, they typically raise rates. Faced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?

Their best play is to leave rates where they are until it is clear which problem requires addressing with a rate change. In fact, that’s just what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday. Given that the appropriate path for Fed policy is “not clear at this time,” he said, “it feels like we don’t need to be in a hurry.”

So, what’s the problem? Well, here’s what the president posted on Truth Social that same day, as the stock market was tanking: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always “late,” but he could now change his image, and quickly.”

“CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” Trump concluded.

Now, to understand what’s going on here, we need to go back to one of Powell’s predecessors, Alan Greenspan. Under Greenspan, the Fed was so consistent in cutting rates as soon as the market softened that investors came to depend on the Fed chair to protect them from bear markets. This was known as the “Greenspan put,” a reference to a financial tool by which an investor is protected from downside losses.

To be clear, I’m not saying Trump is an avid student of monetary history. I am saying he wants and expects Powell to bail him out, and he know there’s a precedent for the Fed to provide a macroeconomic insurance policy against a policy shock, even if it’s Trump’s own doing.

If you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too high.

His post also reveals that he’s clearly uninterested in a guiding principle of past administrations, including the Biden presidency, during which I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers. When I was asked about Fed policy, with zero exceptions, my answer was to say nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, but nothing more than this: “We don’t talk about Fed policy because we are fully committed to Fed independence. History is littered with examples of economies severely damaged by the inflation unleashed by pressuring the Fed to cut rates.” In fact, at CEA, we published a detailed defense of this stance, showing the historical importance of Fed independence, especially to control inflation.

It’s common sense. If you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too damn high.

There’s one more important wrinkle here for the Fed to consider. Because a tariff is a tax that takes effect at a point in time and stays on until it’s lifted, it does raise prices, but it does so just once. You get a spike in inflation over a month or two, and then inflation drifts back to where it was pre-tariff. Economists call this a “one-time rise in the price level” versus a permanently higher inflation rate.

The Fed probably doesn’t like that anymore than you or I do, but as long as inflation doesn’t stay elevated, it doesn't have to raise interest rates to get it back down.

That could work to Trump’s advantage — unless the tariffs just keep coming. Remember, the scenario I just outlined requires one and done. But if Trump keeps lurching around the way he has since he got back into office, the producers, businesses and employers who set prices and wages in the economy are going to expect ever-higher price pressures.

This is a huge problem for the Fed that deeply depends on inflationary expectations remaining “anchored.” A one-time hit doesn’t dislodge the anchor. But repeated hits definitely can. As Powell said Friday, “While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent … Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”

The upshot is that Powell and the Federal Reserve must ignore Trump, maintain independence, watch what happens to both policy and inflation, and raise or lower rates as they see fit. But ignoring Trump is a lot easier said than done. Especially if the markets keep tanking, Trump will demand a “Powell put” with increasing fury. But the Fed chair is unquestionably right about tuning Trump out, and those of us who speak on such matters should give him all the backup we can.",Left

Speaking to reporters Sunday on Air Force One, President Donald Trump defended his new global tariffs with a familiar series of false claims about tariffs and trade.

As he has before, Trump wildly exaggerated the US trade deficit with China — describing it as more than three times higher than it actually is. He repeated his frequent false claim that China paid the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency on imported Chinese products; these payments were made by US importers. And he once again falsely described trade with Europe, wrongly saying the continent doesn’t buy “anything” from the US. In reality, the European Union purchased about $649 billion worth of US exports in 2024.

Trump’s Sunday remarks also included inaccurate assertions about other subjects, but we’ll stick to tariffs and trade in this article. Here is a fact check.

The US trade deficit with China

Trump said Sunday that the US has a trade deficit with China of $1 trillion or more.

“We have a tremendous deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it’s like a trillion-one,” he said.

As we’ve noted in previous fact checks, those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal statistics show the 2024 trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion.

The US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alone hit a record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.

Trump’s tariffs on China

Trump repeated his regular assertion that China paid the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports during his first presidency, wrongly declaring, “I took in, during my four year(s), hundreds of billions of dollars from China.”

In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments to the US government, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on China. It’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.

Trade with Europe

Trump made a series of false claims about trade with Europe, all repeats from previous comments.

He said Sunday: “They don’t take our cars. They don’t take our food products. They don’t take anything. And we take their cars: Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don’t take our farm product. They don’t take anything. “

None of this is correct.

“They don’t take anything” is far from the truth. While the European Union certainly has some trade barriers that make it harder for US companies to export products there, the official federal statistics show the US exported about $649 billion worth of goods and services to the European Union in 2024.

It’s similarly false that “they don’t take our farm products.” While the EU does have some trade barriers that impede US agricultural exports, the US Department of Agriculture says the EU bought $12.8 billion worth of US agricultural exports in 2024, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind Mexico, Canada and China.

And while US automakers have often struggled to succeed in Europe, Trump went too far when he said, “They take no cars.” According to a report last month from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, “164,857 US-made cars were exported to the EU in 2024,” valued at about $8.4 billion at current exchange rates.

The Supreme Court declined Monday to decide whether a New York law that requires residents to have “good moral character” to carry a handgun is constitutional, leaving in place most of the state’s ban on carrying weapons in “sensitive places,” such as schools, parks and theaters.

The decision is a victory for New York officials and gun control groups, who have been attempting to approve or defend gun prohibitions in the wake of a blockbuster 2022 Supreme Court precedent that widely expanded the ability of Americans to carry guns in public. The New York law in question in the case was a response to that decision.

The court didn’t explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents.

The state’s law requires residents to show “good moral character” to obtain a firearm license. The new law defined that term to mean “having the essential character, temperament and judgement necessary to be entrusted with a weapon and to use it only in a manner that does not endanger oneself or others.”

The law also set aside several “sensitive” locations where carrying weapons is banned. New York included government buildings, schools, hospitals, stadiums and Times Square in the list of covered spaces. Whether that approach can survive court scrutiny is being closely watched by other states.

Gun rights groups challenging the law say the number of scope of sensitive places cover “virtually the entire landmass of New York” and makes carrying a weapon “so risky that even the hyper-law-abiding licensee would not dare.” The lawsuit was filed by five New Yorkers with licenses to carry firearms and one individual who has argued the law has deterred him from obtaining a license.

The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court in January.

The appeal has been up at the Supreme Court before – and has been heavily influenced by the court’s decisions. The case is largely based on the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which struck down a New York requirement that residents show good cause to obtain a license to carry a handgun outside of their home. Gun control groups have argued that New York is trying to flout the high court’s decision in Bruen.

The decision Monday was the latest in which the high court declined to take up appeals that have followed from the Bruen decision in recent years. The justices have for weeks been considering several other Second Amendment appeals, including one dealing with Maryland’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles.

In addition to striking down New York’s law at the time, the Supreme Court set a new, history-based standard for review gun prohibitions. In order to pass judicial scrutiny, the court ruled, a gun law must have some connection with gun regulations in place at the time of the nation’s founding. That ruling has sparked considerable uncertainty in lower court about just how much a connection is required.

The Supreme Court tried to clarify things with a decision last year when it upheld a federal law that bars people who are the subject of certain domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns.

After reviewing the New York case in light of the decision on restraining orders, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of the state’s law last fall. It did, however, let stand a lower court order blocking enforcement of the state’s ban on carrying concealed weapons in certain privately owned retail establishments, such as supermarkets and restaurants.",Left

Elon Musk has claimed the Department of Government Efficiency is “the most transparent organization in government ever.” But Merici Vinton, a federal worker who recently left her job at the government information technology office weeks after it was taken over by DOGE, told CNN in an interview she witnessed a “highly secretive” effort operating by “a different set of rules.”

She described a wave of new staffers with limited knowledge of how federal agencies operate taking a bulldozer-like approach to shrinking the government — moves made with “a careless disregard for trying to understand how the work happens and what the rules and policies are.”

“A lot of government culture, love it or not, is about collaboration and consensus-building. That has not been the DOGE approach,” Vinton said. “They kind of do things their own way.”

In her first network interview since stepping down, Vinton offered an inside perspective on the events that unfolded at the US Digital Service. She watched as it turned into the staging ground for the administration’s push to drastically slash spending, reduce the federal workforce and remake the government around Trump’s priorities.

The DOGE effort — which has led to massive layoffs, canceled contracts and at times wildly inaccurate claims about federal spending — has played a pivotal role in shaping public opinion of Trump’s second term.

Vinton, 44, started in 2021 at USDS, the executive branch office created under President Barack Obama to improve technology across the federal government. She worked on the temporary expansion of the child tax credit and was one of the architects of Direct File, which allows many Americans to file their taxes directly with the Internal Revenue Service. Vinton said she joined USDS to support rebuilding efforts after the Covid-19 pandemic.

She voluntarily left the government in March, roughly two months after the Trump administration transformed USDS into DOGE, allowing the initiative to occupy an existing government entity rather than creating a new one to run the cost-cutting operation.

In the past, the office’s work, she said, has been “apolitical.”

“I came to government to really build great experiences for people, to interact with government to get their benefits easier, to file their taxes easier, to get their tax refunds quicker,” Vinton said. “That’s why I joined government. What I see DOGE is doing is, they’re actually breaking a lot of that down. They’re actually breaking those things apart.”

“I think it’s going to be incredibly hard to rebuild,” she said.

DOGE officials did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘Two separate teams’

Vinton said she and other employees learned that USDS would be turned into DOGE on Trump’s Inauguration Day, when the president signed an executive order rebranding the agency.

“We were all stunned,” Vinton said. “That evening, we received invites to interviews to meet our new colleagues.”

She said DOGE representatives wearing temporary badges and identifying themselves by only their first names conducted 15-minute interviews with the agency’s 162 employees the next day. Those questions included some unusual queries about “what makes you exceptional” and “who’s your favorite person” working at the agency.

“It didn’t really feel like a serious set of questions,” she said. “You know, the work that we do can be really hard and really complex. And these questions were … kind of random, didn’t really feel like they were going to meet a complexity of the work that we do.”

Soon, she said, “it became very clear there (were) two separate teams” working at USDS: a DOGE team coordinating the sweeping government reduction mission and the residual USDS office, with the carryover employees struggling to keep alive what was left of existing IT improvement projects.

“After we had these 15-minute interviews, we really didn’t know much about our futures. We didn’t know if we were going to be the next fired, and we frankly all expected that. And so, for about a month and a half, we were rudderless. There was not a lot of leadership. People were just trying to plod along and do their work,” she said.

On the night of Valentine’s Day — less than a month after Trump took office — 43 of the agency’s employees received 8 p.m. emails notifying them they were being fired, Vinton said. Less than two weeks later, another 21 employees resigned in protest.

“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services. We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions,” those employees said in a resignation letter to Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Vinton said the atmosphere at the agency changed for its pre-DOGE employees. She described it as “a bit sad, a bit like a funeral.”

Vinton insisted her personal politics did not influence her observations. While Vinton started at USDS during the Biden administration and supports Democrats, her job is considered apolitical. Earlier in her life, she was a registered Republican, and she said she has voted for GOP and Democratic candidates.

‘A convenient container’

Vinton said she isn’t sure who is actually leading DOGE on a day-to-day basis.

She said she never met Musk, and that Amy Gleason, the agency’s acting administrator, “made clear to us that she was overseeing more of the USDS legacy work and not calling the shots elsewhere.”

Gleason started running USDS’ daily meetings after the mass purge of Vinton’s colleagues in mid-February, but the staff received no formal announcement that she was named acting administrator, even after the media reported the appointment based on White House sources.

Court filings have revealed Gleason is also working as a consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services — similar to several other DOGE affiliates who are working at multiple agencies at once — leaving judges to question who is actually directing the implementation of the DOGE agenda.

Some of Vinton’s work was at the IRS, and she had a view into how the DOGE team was operating there. She observed the operatives embedded at that agency — who were often young and had no government experience — to be “highly empowered, as individuals, to make decisions and to determine their activities day-to-day.”

“I never understood who they, you know, were necessarily reporting into, other than … Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent,” she said. “It was very unclear to me who was ultimately calling those shots.”

But the benefits for DOGE in using USDS as its launchpad became apparent to Vinton.

“They could have access to the White House through our office space, they could have access to email accounts and … the ability to hire people,” Vinton said. “So, we very much felt just like a convenient container for DOGE.”

Trump also moved USDS from its longtime home at the Office of Management and Budget — where it would be subject to the Freedom of Information Act and other government transparency laws — to the Executive Office of the President, which is much harder to penetrate from an oversight perspective.

Firing ‘your brand-new recruitment class’

Vinton was sharply critical of the Trump administration’s moves to lay off probationary employees — those hired most recently. Vinton said many of those employees were brought into the government because they had specific skills needed at the agencies.

“A lot of those were highly technical people who we recruited, we brought in, because we were so excited about the technical skills that they brought to government. It’s not efficient to fire, you know, your brand-new recruitment class, who brings the newest skills,” she said.

Vinton said what worries her most is that Trump’s cuts across federal agencies will make it impossible for future administrations to rebuild the government’s ability to deliver the services Americans expect.

“I want Americans to try to understand it and to believe it and to understand that what it is a wrecking ball, and that it’s not a scalpel,” Vinton said. “It is going to dramatically decrease our government’s capacity to deliver services and benefits in the next few years.”

“This is real, and it’s not in a bubble,” she said.",Left

It hardly seemed like good news for Ukraine when Donald Trump won in November, but the reality has been worse than most expected. While pursuing a thus-far illusory Russia/Ukraine cease-fire, Trump labeled Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator,” embraced Vladimir Putin’s version of the war’s history, demanded that Ukraine hand over much of its mineral wealth, and castigated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Yet as the U.S. pulls back from its role as Ukraine’s central backer and Europe struggles to fill that void, the actual battlefield in Ukraine has not changed very much. Given the international headwinds, can this equilibrium last much longer? To get a picture of the military and political reality in Ukraine and what the rest of 2025 may bring, I called Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, whom I have spoken with several times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago.

When we talked in October, Russia had the clear momentum on the battlefield, and it seemed like it might be on the verge of seizing at least one more significant city, Pokrovsk. But that hasn’t happened. It hasn’t really made significant progress since then, except in Kursk, the small area of Russia Ukraine invaded. Can you explain why that is and give an overview of where things stand on the battlefield in Ukraine?

﻿We’re talking about the past several months, not necessarily about how things are likely to evolve in the spring and summer. But if we go back to the fall, things were looking quite a bit more grim. Russian forces were making accelerated gains on the ground, and they were taking more territory each month from July until November. Then their momentum slowed down considerably over the course of the winter.

The first reason for this, from my point of view, was weather. That may seem a bit of an obvious point, but it did significantly affect Russian operations over the course of the winter. The second was a degree of exhaustion. The Russian military paid a high price for those gains we saw in the fall, both in terms of manpower and equipment. Russian losses in September and October were high, and it pulled units out to reconstitute or regroup.

The third, which I found most interesting from my field work in Ukraine, was that the Ukrainian military began to successfully adapt to how Russian forces were fighting. If we take a wider look at 2024, the Russian military had made a general trade-off in how it was prosecuting the fight. It was essentially grinding its way through the front and pressing Ukrainian forces from their positions in a way that wasn’t going to achieve operationally significant breakthroughs for the Russian armed forces but could make use of their fairly poor force quality and their significant advantage in manpower and matériel. On the ground, what that looked like in practice was essentially assault groups of small numbers of men, fire teams, light motorized attacks, alternating with mechanized attacks — but generally staying away from attempts at large-scale combat operations or big envelopments.

And Ukraine adjusted?

﻿Ukrainian military members made significant investments in countering that approach. First, they very effectively mined themselves in, particularly employing drones to distance-mine. They also expanded drone units in an effort to lock down the front. This has been the main part of the Ukrainian effort — that is, expanding the drone part of the force, such that drones of various types are now responsible for probably 60 to 70 percent of the Russian casualties compared to earlier periods of the war when it was chiefly artillery or small-arms fire, those types of means. Then there’s still traditional artillery fires. This combination of effective defensive/offensive mining, using strike drones to attrit Russian forces at the tactical level such that most Russian attacks don’t get to Ukrainian defensive lines, and to some extent, artillery fires — I won’t say it successfully countered the Russian approach, but it took away many of its advantages and has more effectively compensated for Ukraine’s deficit of infantry and the lack of manpower at the front to hold the front lines.

So from late 2023 through ’24, Russian forces focused on assault groups, detachments, and essentially a means of attacking that was difficult to exhaust on the one hand, but on the other hand it wasn’t conducive to making big breakthroughs. Ukrainian forces then adapted in a way that allowed them to compensate to a degree for the lack of infantry at the front line but also specifically to counter how Russian forces were fighting.

Is this approach going to ultimately address Ukraine’s mobilization manpower issues? I’m not sure, but it is certainly buying Ukraine time this year, it’s cost-effective, and it plays to Ukraine’s comparative advantage. That said, I don’t know if the trends we’ve observed the past couple of months will hold as Russian forces are likely to resume offensive efforts over the course of the spring and summer. So it’s still unclear if we are seeing the beginning of a successful approach that will stabilize the front line for Ukraine, which I think is possible — especially looking at personnel changes and leadership changes, in combination with the technological innovations and tactical adaptations we can observe — or if this might end up being the best period of the war for 2025. The jury on that, I think, is still out.

What do you think a new Russian offensive might look like? Would it be similar to what they were doing when they had the momentum last year? Or a different approach?

﻿The Russian military has been intensifying offensive efforts since the middle of February, and it’s not been especially successful outside Kursk. Although I think we should caveat that by saying that a percentage of Russian effort was very much focused on Kursk, and it was a priority for it. At this point it’s largely pushed the Ukrainian military out of the Kursk pocket. Ukraine is still holding a wedge there on fairly advantageous terrain, but nonetheless Kursk at this point I think is largely a defensive operation for Ukraine meant to protect the Sumy region. I suspect the Russian military is going to redeploy a lot of forces from Kursk back down toward Donetsk and also try to stretch the Ukrainian military by conducting attacks in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia. That’s already been taking place over the past two weeks.

The question is whether the Russian military is actually able to adapt once again this year. Because Ukrainian armed forces, in the investments they’ve made, are trying to lock down the front line and do have a chance of holding the Russian military to incremental gains. It’s just a question of — can they sustain it? And can they count on external material assistance? Although here, too, it’s worth mentioning that in 2025, Ukraine is far less dependent on the West for day-to-day battlefield needs than it was in previous years.

Trump briefly cut off military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine before restoring it and may do so again. But as you say, Ukraine is better equipped to fend for itself these days. So how alarmed are people you speak to on the ground about the prospect of another U.S. cessation of arms, and how long could Ukraine hold out for if that happened?

﻿The first question is easier to answer than the second. As you know from our past conversations, I’m reticent to give hard timelines and predictions — I hold to the adage that military analysis, while it has to try to be predictive, is not fortune-telling.

To your first question, the main areas where Ukrainian forces are dependent on the United States in particular are precision-strike capabilities. That is, employment of GMLRS missiles fired by primarily HIMARS systems or M270s. This allows Ukraine to hold the Russian rear at risk — that is things beyond 30-kilometer depth on the front line. I think that if Ukraine were to run out of missiles for HIMARS systems, it would certainly affect the course of fighting this year, because it will substantially free up Russian forces and how they organize logistics and command and control behind the front. The secondary dependence is in air defense, specifically Patriot-missile batteries, which depend on not only western support, like parts maintenance, but also the actual interceptors. And there I can’t say how many months’ worth of munitions Ukraine has, but it would become quite problematic for Ukrainian air defense, I think, because there is no substitute for the missiles the U.S. has been supplying.

You mentioned intelligence support and various other forms of, let’s say, non-matériel systems. There I think it’s a bit debatable how much allies could take over, but it would certainly be an additional factor. How long could Ukraine hold out? This depends on a couple of factors. First, what is the offensive potential of the Russian military and what kind of offensive does it intend to launch in the spring and summer? Second, to what extent can Ukraine’s other western partners step in? I think when it comes to artillery production, Europe is in a much better position now than it was in previous years. I think in many categories, other than the ones I just outlined, the Europeans could step in and help sustain the Ukrainian military effort.

And Ukraine itself now makes many of the munitions and drones that it needs, including mines. So if we’re looking at the tactical level and what’s being consumed the most at the front, Ukraine could probably sustain itself for quite some time, and we’d be seeing a steady degradation rather than any sort of sudden collapse. And even then, the jury’s out on how the fighting might unfold. But the impact would be visible over time, and I think one should not be too cavalier or hand-wave away the extent to which U.S. support and U.S. organization of military assistance writ large for Ukraine has been a significant contributor to Ukraine’s military efforts.

The other factor here is the possibility of some kind of cease-fire. Ukraine and Russia agreed to a limited one, on energy infrastructure, but that hasn’t been successful, and Russia keeps killing civilians across Ukraine. Plans for any kind of larger cease-fire have gone nowhere. And now Trump and Rubio seem annoyed that Putin might not be interested. Is what Trump wants and what Putin wants totally incompatible? What would a satisfactory cease-fire to Russia even look like?

﻿I think the Russian view is that despite the fact that its military is woefully underperforming relative to its expectations and its overall matériel advantages, that if it’s going to agree to a cease-fire it would have to be a heavily conditioned one. Russian leadership has sought Ukrainian capitulation, which it can’t achieve on the battlefield. So instead, it’s trying to attain western capitulation, to an extent. And here, it feels it has a stronger chance of getting a lot of what it wants.

Naturally, Russian leadership is stalling to the extent they can. But most importantly, they are trying to position the Russian-Ukraine war as one issue, or one negotiation topic, among an entire package within which they would like diplomatic normalization, economic normalization, some restored role for Russian conversations about European security. And what they’re essentially doing over the course of this time period, if we look at the process, is they are maneuvering this war away from being the central organizing principle in U.S. foreign policy under the previous administration. That is, everything was linked to the fact that Russia had invaded Ukraine and was conducting this atrocious war in Europe. They’re trying to isolate and sideline the war as one problem set among a series in U.S.-Russia relations and trying to decouple U.S.-Russia relations from the war.

What they want is a host of western concessions, not just on the question of Ukraine but on this other set of issues. The challenge that Moscow has is that Trump very much wanted the cease-fire by the first hundred days and had issued this as a fairly hard deadline. Russia’s efforts to say “yes” in theory but “no” in practice have a limited shelf life, because I’m sure it’s clear now to folks in the White House that the Russians have no intention of agreeing to a cease-fire anytime soon. And that even if they were to agree to a cease-fire, the odds that it would last and prove durable from my point of view are exceedingly low, given the track record of cease-fires with Russia, especially in this war.

So what is Russia actually looking for in these negotiations?

﻿I think what Moscow wants isn’t even a rescinding of sanctions but rather a pullback of U.S. enforcement, particularly of secondary sanctions. And that by itself will already give it the slack it needs in order to sustain the war effort this year.

Naturally, its dream would be to have sanctions that are the most effective lifted as part of this process, perhaps get to a cease-fire, then have the cease-fire collapse. But the other important part of this interaction, as best I can tell, is that both sides are trying to position the other as the party most responsible for the fact that there’s no cease-fire, come 100 days into the Trump administration. From my point of view, this is the game Moscow is trying to play. The question is, at the end of this month, who will the Trump administration blame? Or will it blame both Russia and Ukraine out of frustration as it’s had a tendency to do? And what are the possible consequences for Ukraine?

I think the one thing that Ukraine certainly has going for it beyond its own resilience is that Moscow has a strong tendency to overplay its hand and to get overly ambitious in these types of negotiations with the U.S. And while Russia retains the advantage in this war, its actual hand — if we look at Russian military performance relative to its maximalist demands and its political objectives — isn’t especially good. And it could very well come off in the coming days or weeks as the party that is the least realistic and the most recalcitrant and the most greedy in the negotiations given its actual position.

That could never just describe the Trump administration, of course.

﻿The other important factor is, of course, Europeans. Europeans are not likely to go along, particularly the leading European nations.

Lifting Russian sanctions would depend on them, too, right? It’s not unilateral.

﻿Yes. It actually depends on them in some respects, a lot more than it depends on us. They’re not likely to go along with a substantial lifting of sanctions. They’re also not likely to go along with any effort to revise Russia’s role in European security. And they will probably make a best effort in order to enable Ukraine, such that Ukraine doesn’t necessarily have to accept a bad deal. Because the reality on the ground is that while the overall dynamic in the war hasn’t changed, and I wouldn’t spin it overly positively, the front line is not about to collapse, and Ukraine is not in some dire position such that it desperately needs a cease-fire right now. That said, I wouldn’t make the other extreme version of this argument, suggesting that the entire dynamic has changed and that Ukraine has turned things around so dramatically that we can now have a completely different set of assumptions and expectations about the course of the war. That, too, is not true.

And it seems like there’s little hope of Ukraine gaining more territory, at least within Ukraine itself. It may be launching another limited operation in Russia, but it’s not like it’s going on the offensive elsewhere anytime soon.

﻿It’s conducted fairly small-scale localized counterattacks in the past couple months, mostly to improve positions along the front line. The honest answer is I don’t know if Ukraine is planning another offensive operation, but looking at the overall trajectory in this war, I think Ukraine’s focus is and probably should be stabilizing the front, playing to some extent for time, and looking for ways to effectively exhaust Russian offensive potential while maximizing the cost to Russia, such that the Russian war effort in general reaches diminishing returns and the host of economic and other issues that Moscow has to deal with grow in significance and affect the sustainability of the military effort if this war goes on through 2025.

Then negotiate some kind of cease-fire from that position of relative strength.

﻿If not from a position of strength, certainly not from a position of desperation or weakness. There is a significant range of outcomes you could have between these extremes. But most importantly, you would not have to accept a deal that would be fundamentally unacceptable to Ukrainian society, and that would make much of the war not worth it in the first place. Any society that sacrificed this much in a war of this scale that’s gone on now for over three years is always going to ask, “What was the point of the sacrifice if this is the political outcome that the war achieved?”

What I think is often difficult for some colleagues in the West to understand is the reason why the Ukrainian leadership is reluctant to just accept the cease-fire is that if all a cease-fire does is lead to a rearmament period. If there’s nothing supporting the cease-fire, then what follows very likely could be much worse for Ukraine. People will leave, a large part of the army may have to be demobilized, and Russia will simply come back — maybe in a year, maybe in four years, but it’s not likely to invade again in the way that it conducted the full-scale invasion of 2022. And in the third iteration of the war, the consequence for Ukraine could be even more dire.

That is why I think many in Ukrainian society and in Ukrainian political leadership rightfully ask — what is the point of getting a piece of paper that just says the word cease-fire on it when ultimately it doesn’t end the war, it doesn’t attain any security for Ukraine, and it doesn’t ensure the return of people or investment to Ukraine but simply leaves Ukraine as a country and a society in a prolonged period of jeopardy and facing the likelihood of a renewed war at any point in the future?

While also possibly handing off natural resources to the United States in exchange for zero security guarantees.

﻿In exchange for what looks like nothing.

It seemed like this minerals deal was about to happen, but it hasn’t yet. Why sign on those kinds of terms?

﻿I can only give you my opinion, which is that I think the mineral deal was a scheme meant to explain here in America why the U.S. was still supporting Ukraine and what the return for the United States would be in a very transactional and, I think to some extent, cynical sort of way. But it’s also a gateway deal to a series of other deals that were meant to follow. If you look at all the earlier drafts, it had very strong neo-colonialist overtones and it looked decidedly predatory. That draft was visibly revised over time, but the latest iterations I’ve seen look just as predatory and extractionist as the earlier version. So I’m not sure where we are at this point.

Trump and J.D. Vance attempted to humiliate Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and that predictably led to a swell of support for Zelenskyy in Ukraine. Does it seem like Ukraine’s people are perhaps more supportive of this war effort now because of what’s happened in the U.S. than they were before? Because it seemed like a few months ago there was quite a bit of restiveness among the population with his approach, and now it seems like there’s a new sense of patriotism going on.

﻿I think it’s important to disambiguate the two parts of your question. The first is the rally-around-the-flag effect that Zelenskyy experienced in publicly defending Ukraine and Ukrainian interests, first in the course of negotiations over the minerals deal, then second during that disastrous White House meeting. The second aspect is Ukrainian public sentiment with respect to the war. Ukrainian society has of course grown increasingly tired of the ongoing conflict, and many would like the war to end. However, they’re not willing to make major concessions to Russia. And when we look at the domestic political leadership, they are heavily constrained by public attitudes and in my view haven’t done much to shape them.

Plus, many are increasingly looking to future elections, which are likely to follow any cease-fire agreement. And there’s a tendency to get ahead of oneself, where elites begin positioning themselves for the parliamentary and presidential elections to come while having not actually figured out how this war ends. And this can lead to a degree of shortsightedness or a lack of serious thinking about the immediate while fixating on its political implications.

One of the biggest challenges that Ukraine has in making a deal — and it’s not a challenge, it’s frankly a feature — is the fact that Ukraine is ultimately a democracy, and the Ukrainian political leadership can’t just sign any deal the way Putin might. Leaders will be looking over their shoulders over the course of the process, as you saw in the negotiation with the United States on the minerals deal, to see what the public reaction is. And they understand that they can make a deal, but the public may not accept this deal.

So I think there’s a degree of learning probably taking place once again here in the United States that you can’t so easily force Ukraine or Ukrainian leadership into a deal. And that the amount of leverage that the United States has over Ukraine and over Russia, while probably more significant in the case of Ukraine, nonetheless is grossly insufficient if the question is “Can the United States force Russia and Ukraine into a cease-fire that they themselves do not want or do not want right now?”

So that leaves us with a muddle.

﻿There’s a reason why wars like this tend to go on well beyond the decisive phase of the war and negotiations may take months or years, if we look at historical cases. It’s very difficult to get society and elites, if they represent their society, to compromise. It is also exceedingly difficult to get leaders to make an agreement with a party they don’t trust, and to get them to agree to something that they don’t think actually answers any of the big questions for their country or won’t yield a solution to the war — especially if you’re not willing to offer security guarantees or anything else to backstop that arrangement.

Few modern Supreme Court ascensions have felt as baldly predetermined, even scripted, as Amy Coney Barrett’s.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was still alive, and would be for two more years, when Donald Trump started telling people he was “saving” Barrett, then just confirmed to her first judgeship, for Ginsburg’s seat. He waited a whole week after Ginsburg’s death in September 2020 to push through Barrett’s nomination before the presidential election. At her confirmation hearing, there was little attempt to recast Barrett — who had a scant record as a judge but a plain history of ideological commitment — as a caller of balls and strikes. Instead, Republicans sold her to the public with an undisguised mash-up of conservative identity politics and quasi-feminist rhetoric. “All the young conservative women out there,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, at her nomination hearing, “this hearing, to me, is about a place for you.”

Barrett has, in large part, held up her end of the cynical deal. She provided the lone female vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and helped deliver conservative wins on guns and affirmative action. According to numbers crunched by Adam Feldman on Legalytics, since joining the Court, she’s voted with her fellow Trump appointees around 90 percent of the time. She’s hardly the second coming of, say, Justice John Paul Stevens, a Republican appointee who, by the time of his retirement in 2010, was considered a leader of the Court’s liberal wing.

Barrett has, however, recently shown that she is not a rubber stamp for Trumpism and will occasionally break from the party line if there’s a question of principle or procedural integrity. About a year into her tenure, Feldman wrote, and on a handful of occasions, Barrett did what some of her colleagues hardly ever do — vote with the Court’s center-liberal bloc: “Her willingness to prioritize fairness, clarity, and state autonomy over strict ideological loyalty has led to surprising alignments with the Court’s liberal wing in key cases.” Other court watchers have noticed the trend. “There are glimmers of real independence to her,” says NYU law professor Melissa Murray. Georgetown law professor Stephen Vladeck, who last summer wrote a New York Times op-ed calling Barrett “the most interesting justice” in part because of her willingness to break from the GOP pack, says what’s transpired since has only strengthened the case. Indeed, her incremental moves in the first few months of this year have already been enough to drive the MAGA right to hysterics.

In January, Barrett appeared to join Chief Justice John Roberts and the Democratic appointees in allowing Trump’s sentencing in his hush-money case to move forward, while the other Republican appointees would have granted Trump’s wish to block it. Then, in early March, Barrett wrote a partial dissent in a case involving the Clean Air Act that was joined by all three Democratic appointees. The next day, she and Roberts joined those same liberals to at least slow Trump’s decimation of foreign aid, leaving Samuel Alito to write a sputtering dissent. “Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” he wrote of the abruptly canceled USAID contracts. “The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.”

So, apparently, was the right-wing commentariat. Mike Davis, a former Neil Gorsuch clerk and staffer on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, told Steve Bannon that Barrett is “a rattled law professor with her head up her ass.” Much was made of a clip of Barrett seeming to grimace at Trump as he walked by her at the joint address to Congress that same week. “She is evil, chosen solely because she checked identity-politics boxes,” raged Mike Cernovich. Laura Loomer called her a DEI hire. Allegations of “evil” aside, there was some technical truth to this; Graham’s chief counsel for nominations wrote that week that Barrett being a woman, being a conservative Catholic, and having a thin record were crucial to getting her through the Senate at a blisteringly quick pace, but he claimed that was “politics” and not DEI.

Though Roberts has previously enraged conservatives with his votes on cases involving the Affordable Care Act and immigration, and Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have broken ranks, “Barrett’s the only one they call a DEI hire,” points out University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman. (Such dismissiveness is already assumed with the justices appointed by Democrats.) Barrett’s true crime, of course, is insufficient fealty to Trump. When law professor Josh Blackman called for her to resign, one of his stated reasons was that “I am fairly confident she does not like President Trump.” A few lone voices on the right, mainly lawyers whose allegiances encompass but aren’t limited to Trump, defended her, including one of the men credited with handpicking her, Leonard Leo — while hastening to add that he agreed with Alito on the USAID case.

It remains to be seen just how far Barrett is willing to stray from the party line. On Friday, Barrett provided the fifth vote to grant the Trump administration’s emergency petition, allowing the government to cancel grants to teachers for supposedly violating the anti-DEI executive order. Roberts, on the other hand, would have allowed the status quo to continue until the case got a full hearing, though he didn’t join the liberals’ bluntly furious dissents.

It was one of a half-dozen cases in which the Supreme Court has been asked by Trump to intervene after lower-court judges uniformly blocked Trump’s rampage through the federal government. The emergency petitions range from challenges to the executive orders on birthright citizenship to the lawfulness of mass-firing federal employees to whether the administration can rely on the Alien Enemies Act to deny due process in deportations. Whether at least five of the conservative justices on the Court agree with their colleagues below or whether they change the rules for Trump will be the true test of the Court itself, and of how far Barrett is willing to diverge from the man who appointed her. For the die-hard Trump crowd, Barrett may pose a genuine threat, says Vladeck: “I think they’re correct to be worried if their only principle is winning.”

There’s more at stake for the Court here than just who wins or loses this round. The administration is betting that it can wield its power in unheard-of ways, even in apparent defiance of lower-court judges. That may be because it assumes five justices will scramble to back Trump’s agenda, but it’s also plausible it doesn’t care what any judges have to say about Trump’s lawlessness. It’s hard to know which scenario is more frightening.

In the meantime, the right might also not be doing itself any favors by antagonizing Barrett. “The ferocity with which the right has turned on her has to stick in her craw,” says Murray. “She was the darling of the right in 2020.” Trump himself arguably showed more political savvy than his flunkies when he told pool reporters, “She’s a very good woman. She’s very smart, and I don’t know about people attacking her, I really don’t know. I think she’s a very good woman.”

That’s the outside game. On the inside, it’s an open question as to how the interpersonal dynamics of the different ideological strands on the right and the center-left will play out. The two furthest-right members of the Court have staked their positions: “We’ve seen increasingly unrestrained rhetoric from Alito and Thomas,” says Vladeck. “We can’t know what that’s doing inside the building, but on paper it seems to be exacerbating the differences between them.”

Meanwhile, both Murray and Litman observed that some of the other justices on both sides of the aisle appear to be more solicitous of Barrett in oral argument. With the current composition of the Court, Barrett rarely has the opportunity to be a swing vote — Feldman identified a total number of six cases out of 30 so far in which she made the difference in the result — but, along with Roberts and occasionally Kavanaugh, can form a bloc of relative moderation. She’s only 53 and has plenty of time to make her mark.

“I’m not chartering the ACB fan club yet,” says Murray. “But I’m watching. I’m interested.” She concedes this could all be the latest Trump-era way for liberals to grasp at straws. “I’d like to believe that there’s some limit to the outright hackishness,” she adds, “but I don’t know if that’s true.”",Left

The global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.

Although the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump’s billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down – its worst day since 1997. The city’s financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.

• Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day’s trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump’s tariffs.

• US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.

• Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump’s tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America’s standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.

• Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn’t want “anything to go down,” but that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.

• Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman, another of Trump’s billionaire backers, has also criticized the president’s trade policy.

• MAGA’s mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration “doesn’t have a coherent message on why it’s implementing the largest tax increase” seen in the US in 50 years.",Left

Shocking images out of Memphis, Tennessee, and Little Rock, Arkansas, show flooding in the streets as a result of heavy rainfall from late last week:

An EF-3 tornado also tore through southwestern Tennessee and killed at least ten people, ABC News reported.

Photos and videos of the aftermath show destroyed homes, buildings, and vehicles:

In Frankfort, Kentucky, nine-year-old Gabriel Andrews was tragically killed by floodwaters while he was walking to the bus stop at around 6:30 a.m. on Friday, WLKY reported.

The young boy’s body was found over two hours later about half a mile away from where he was swept away. An autopsy still has to be completed.

“My heart breaks for the family,” Gov. Andy Beshear (D) told reporters. “And I hope everyone joins Britainy and I in praying for this family after such an unimaginable loss. It sadly underscores just how dangerous floodwaters can be.”

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) also offered his condolences on Sunday after a father and son were killed by a fallen tree on a golf course in Midland, according to ABC.

“Marty, the girls, and I are saddened by the tragic deaths of two Georgians in Muscogee County today as a result of the severe weather. We ask that you join us in keeping their loved ones in our thoughts and prayers, along with all those responding to storm damage,” the governor stated.

The victims, 58-year-old Matthew Terrell Collins Sr. and 29-year-old Matthew Terrell Collins Jr. were crushed to death while sheltering from the storm in their golf cart when a tree fell, WRBL reported.

The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) confirmed the state’s first storm-related death as a five-year-old Little Rock boy, though the circumstances were not reported, according to a local ABC affiliate.

Tragedy struck again on Friday in Franklin County, Missouri when teenage firefighter Chevy Gall died in a vehicle crash while responding to a reported water rescue, with the Beaufort-Leslie Fire Protection District sharing that he was pronounced dead at the hospital after sustaining “critical injuries.”

The condition of the other individual involved in the crash was “unknown” when the fire department shared the bad news late Friday night.

“Tonight is a fire chief’s worst nightmare. We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our own. Chevy died while answering the call to help others. Our entire department is grieving, as we mourn with Chevy’s family, friends, and our fellow first responders during this incredibly difficult time,” said District Fire Chief Terry Feth.

Gall received a dignified transfer by a procession of emergency vehicles on Monday.

In another sad incident, Chief Garry Moore of the Whitewater Fire Protection District was killed while helping a stranded driver on Wednesday.

Moore, 68, is suspected to have been electrocuted by downed power lines as a result of a tornado, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported.

While the storms across several southern and midwestern states have begun to subside, warnings and flood watches are still active with the Ohio River expected to crest on Monday, according to WLWT.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Family and friends of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love are set to gather Monday in Salt Lake City to honor her life and legacy after she died of brain cancer in March at age 49.

Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, was the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress.

The former lawmaker from Utah had undergone treatment for an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial. She died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.

State lawmakers and members of the public visited the Utah Capitol on Sunday evening to pay their respects at Love's flag-covered coffin behind ropes in the building's rotunda.

The public is invited to attend her memorial service Monday morning at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion on the University of Utah campus. It will be followed by an honor guard presentation.

Love, born Ludmya Bourdeau, represented Utah on Capitol Hill from 2015 to 2019. She and her husband, Jason, had three children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton.

She was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2022 and said her doctors estimated she had only 10 to 15 months to live, which she surpassed. With aggressive treatments, Love lived for about three years after receiving her diagnosis.

Love entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She was elected as the city’s mayor in 2009, becoming the first Black woman to serve as a mayor in Utah.

In 2012, after giving a rousing speech at the Republican National Convention, she narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and defeated a first-time candidate by about 7,500 votes.

Love did not emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who suggested a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could not win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.

She was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party fizzled out as President Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from Trump and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations. Later that year, she lost in the midterm elections as Democrats surged.",Lean Left

The other option was to vote for this mafia that has been killing Romania for 35 years.” Alex doesn’t fit the profile of a typical right-wing voter. He’s in his early 30s, works in Bucharest as an IT consultant for a multinational company, speaks fluent English, and even has a ponytail. His feelings on the election sum up the confused state of Romanian politics, which has suddenly emerged as an international flash point, attracting notice from the likes of Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance.

Here are a few of the highlights from Romania’s turbulent election season. In November of last year, Călin Georgescu came out of nowhere to win the first round of the Romanian presidential election, powered by an unusual blend of Euroskepticism, nostalgia, nationalism, and a social media–savvy campaign that was particularly active on TikTok. In December, Romania’s top constitutional court annulled the results and scheduled a new election in May, citing evidence of Russian interference from the Serviciul Român de Informații (SRI), the Romanian domestic intelligence agency. In early March, six people, including a retired general, were arrested for plotting a coup, allegedly with Russian backing. On March 9, the constitutional court upheld a decision by Romania’s Central Election Bureau to bar Georgescu from the rescheduled election entirely. Bucharest has been mostly quiet since the ruling, but right after the decision was announced, pro-Georgescu protesters clashed violently with police. The Romanian mercenary boss Horaţiu Potra, best known for running military operations in sub-Saharan Africa, has called for an armed uprising to overturn the court’s decision.

Since the fall of communism, Romania and its Eastern European counterparts have occupied the awkward position of laggardly younger brothers, striving to catch up to the West’s wealthy, politically stable democracies. The transition to market liberalism and the accession to NATO and the EU of a swathe of countries from the Baltic to the Black Sea were widely celebrated as mile markers on the road to progress. Constitutional crises, disreputable political candidates, and bizarre election cycles were minor bumps in the road.

But what if Romania’s tumultuous election cycle is not a lagging indicator, but a leading one? As voters grapple with the constitutional court’s decision to disqualify Georgescu, Romania’s heady political blend of conspiracism, anti-establishment sentiment, and allegations of foul play may be a preview of upheavals to come across the Western world.

Georgescu is often described as a populist conservative in the mold of Donald Trump or Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of neighboring Hungary. While the anti-establishment message that fueled Georgescu’s sudden rise is similar to trends in other countries, the candidate’s appeal—and the political context in which he operates—isare unique to Romania.

I was introduced to Alex by Dragos Pichiu, another young, tech-savvy Romanian who works for a multinational company. Dragos says Alex is “like a brother,” but they don’t see eye-to-eye on political issues. Alex voted for Georgescu only reluctantly after the results from the November election were annulled. “I just voted for the person who brings the most chaos because I know he’ll bring pain to the establishment,” he says.

Despite averring that he’s “not big into politics,” Dragos was a more enthusiastic Georgescu backer. He believes Georgescu has been treated unfairly by the mainstream Romanian media and foreign journalists. “We are judging a book by its cover,” he says.

Georgescu, says Dragos, is “a person who dared to speak about the system in an open way.” He admires Georgescu’s willingness to give voice to hard truths about high energy prices, Russian relations, and the necessity of ending the war in Ukraine. These same issues have fueled speculation among anti-Georgescu voters that his candidacy was stage-managed by Russia.

Alex is less enamored with Georgescu’s rhetoric than Dragos. “Most of his statements are based on conspiracy theories,” he says, mentioning some of Georgescu’s more outlandish remarks on the dangers of 5G. He is also skeptical of Georgescu’s promises to hold a national referendum on EU membership: “He would worsen our relationship with the EU. We worked hard to get into the EU.” Alex doesn’t want to give this up; neither does Dragos, who says joining the EU was a “fantastic thing” for Romania, although he chafes at his country’s subordinate position within the federation.

Dragos and Alex don’t agree on every issue, but both think the constitutional court overstepped its bounds by disqualifying Georgescu. “If we are aligning with the Western vision, how can we allow the current system to dictate what candidates are eligible?” asks Dragos. He impassionately quotes the definition of democracy from Ion Rațiu, an exiled Romanian dissident who returned after the fall of communism to become an iconic figure in national politics: “I will fight until my last drop of blood so you have the right not to agree with me!” Alex concurs, saying that he didn’t see any credible evidence that Georgescu was manipulated by Russia. “This is democracy,” he says. “If half of Romanian people like his ideas, okay.”

Georgescu has long capitalized on older voters’ rural nostalgia, posting videos of himself bathing in mountain lakes and riding horses. But he also attracts support from younger Romanians like Dragos and Alex, who have no memory of the communist era and have grown up in a Romania that is increasingly wealthy, modern, and connected to the rest of Europe. From 2021 to early 2025, Romania was governed by a grand coalition that included the major center-right and center-left parties, a cumbersome arrangement that seems likely to continue after the spring elections. By running as an independent, without major party backing, Georgescu capitalized on younger voters’ discontent with the status quo.

What is the “system” that voters like Dragos so disdain? Anti-establishment feeling has lately upended Western politics, driven by an increasingly fragmented media landscape, the decline of traditional parties, and the gulf between voters and elected leaders on issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine. In Romania, however, anti-establishment feeling goes beyond dissatisfaction with the country’s unwieldy governing coalition. To understand voters’ attitudes, you have to understand the country’s recent history.

In the 1980s, Romanian communism under Nicolae Ceaușescu was harsh even by Eastern Bloc standards. At a time when many neighboring regimes were attempting to conciliate their restive subjects by subsidizing consumer goods and relaxing political censorship, Ceaușescu was doubling down on repression. Determined to make Romania self-sufficient, his government exported anything of value for ready cash, from domestically-produced electricity to the ethnic Germans of Transylvania, who were sold off to the West German government in a series of secret deals. Ceaușescu’s quest for self-sufficiency was so disastrous that Romania effectively deindustrialized. In 1986, the government implemented a horse-breeding program to make up for the lack of motorized transport. Mandatory Sunday labor programs were introduced across the country. Manpower and horsepower were made to compensate for the country’s deteriorating technical and industrial base.

Ceaușescu’s directives were enforced by the Securitate, Communist Romania’s feared secret police, which relied on a network of spies and informers to keep a harried populace in line. For Americans, the novel to read is Saul Bellow’s The Dean’s December, which follows a Chicago academic’s trip to Bucharest in the 1980s. Bellow’s second wife was Romanian, and he knew of what he wrote; the book effectively conveys the climate of fear and constant surveillance under Romanian communism.

Ironically, it was party insiders who first realized the dangers of Ceaușescu’s draconian rule (in 1989, high-ranking communists sent the dictator a secret letter warning him that he was taking Romania out of Europe). These warnings went unheeded, and the pot suddenly boiled over in 1989. While other Central and Eastern European communist parties saw the writing on the wall and relinquished power peacefully, Ceaușescu was toppled in a short but violent revolution that culminated in his trial and execution. In Czechoslovakia and Poland, dissidents and opposition leaders like Václav Havel and Lech Wałęsa were waiting in the wings to help ease the transition to liberal democracy. In Romania, the brutality and thoroughness of the old regime’s security apparatus meant that there were no such figures to turn to. Instead, Romania’s first elected head of state was Ion Iliescu, a former communist official. He returned to the presidency in 2000 to help usher Romania into NATO.

Insider deal-making and opaque political maneuvers have plagued every post-communist country, but just as Romanian communism was uniquely brutal, the era that followed was especially corrupt and disorienting. Today, there is widespread feeling among Romanians that high-ranking Securitate officers and other regime insiders used their connections to enrich themselves during the country’s confused transition to market liberalism. In 2010, Jaap Scholten, a Dutch journalist who has written extensively on the destruction of the old Transylvanian aristocracy under communism, reported that the first generation of former communists have since been succeeded by their children, who have captured the commanding heights of Romanian society through nepotism and personal connections.

Emil Esanu, a retired banker in the Romanian city of Timișoara, grew up under the communist regime and agrees with Scholten’s diagnosis. “Some of the richest people in this country are the inheritors of the old system,” he says, a fact that explains widespread distrust of the ruling parties. “More or less the same politicians were in power. We will never get rid of corruption unless we make a real change.”

Despite these comments, Emil is no fan of Georgescu. “I would have never voted for this guy,” he says at the outset of our conversation. But he understands why some voters found him appealing. “They want to punish the political class in Romania. They want to retaliate.”

Georgescu, he adds, was able to capitalize on his status as an outsider. “It’s about creating an image of an honest person.”

Other anti-Georgescu voters have noted the potency of his anti-establishment message. Emese Vig is a Hungarian journalist from Cluj-Napoca, a city in Transylvania that is still home to a large Hungarian community. Vig is also skeptical of Georgescu; historically, candidates with his ideological profile have had a contentious relationship with Romania’s Hungarian minority. In 2000, the far-right presidential candidate Vadim Tudor, to whom Georgescu is often compared, threatened to institute martial law in Hungarian areas.

Nevertheless, Vig also understands the power of Georgescu’s messaging. “Romania is dominated by old networks, including former Securitate agents,” she explains. “The political elite just rebranded after the communist era.”

Both Vig and Esanu mention that Georgescu’s anti-establishment message was particularly popular on expatriate social media. Esanu says that many young Romanians working in service industry jobs in Western Europe thrilled at Georgescu’s candidacy. Vig, who has a teenaged son, noticed something similar online. “Many of the Romanians working outside of the country started following Georgescu on TikTok,” she says. “They started communicating with their relatives back in Romania and telling them to vote for Georgescu.”

In scenic provincial cities like Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca, it’s possible to forget the communist era. In Bucharest, however, even casual visitors can’t help but notice reminders of the old regime. In the heart of the city’s former historic district, Ceaușescu leveled 40,000 buildings to make way for a series of grand boulevards and his perversely named House of the People, a blocky, neoclassical hulk that now houses the Romanian parliament. Today, pedestrians approach the palace from the north through the solar panel–lined pathways of Izvor Park. It is an all-too-fitting symbol for a system that, in the eyes of many of its citizens, underwent only cosmetic changes after the fall of communism.

The shadow of the Securitate also looms over modern Romanian politics. The SRI, the domestic intelligence agency that provided the justification for disqualifying Georgescu, is no longer abducting dissidents, but its reach is still long. As of 2021, according to the journalist Paul Hockenos, the SRI had a larger budget than its German sister agency and employed more people than Dutch intelligence. These are striking figures for a country with a negligible military and, at least until the Russian invasion of Ukraine, few obvious foreign threats. When visiting Romania in 2010, Scholten reported that Romanian businessmen would still turn off their phones and remove the batteries during important meetings to avoid government eavesdropping.

Maybe this was misplaced paranoia, but the BTI Transformation Index, an impeccably-credentialed German think tank that tracks countries’ progress towards market democracy, has reached similar conclusions. BTI’s 2024 report on Romania makes for sobering reading. According to the report, media coverage is shaped by “undue influence” on the part of the “military-intelligence establishment.” Some of the report's conclusions echo the most conspiratorial claims of Georgescu supporters: “Important decisions tend to be made in closed circles, where the president and intelligence services are thought to play an important role.”

The report is particularly worrying in light of the SRI’s unwillingness to publicly supply evidence of Georgescu’s connections to Russia. According to BTI, “the degree to which intelligence services have penetrated political parties and controlled various leaders remains a concern; the mechanisms for civilian control over the intelligence community are feeble, even more so than in the past.”

When Alex speaks of a mafia that has been killing Romania for 35 years, this is what he’s referring to. Distrust of establishment political parties and conventional politicians, a potent force in many democracies, is particularly powerful in post-communist Romania.

Despite the Romanian political establishment’s checkered history, the country's post-communist transitional period has seen real progress. Since joining the European Union in 2007, Romania’s economy has boomed, which is evident in everything from the new office buildings dotting the Bucharest skyline to the traffic choking Ceaușescu’s stately (and once largely empty) boulevards. In January, Romania officially joined the EU’s Schengen Zone, allowing its citizens freedom of movement across Central and Western Europe. According to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, Romania now enjoys a higher GDP per capita than Hungary, an astonishing accomplishment for a country that many doubted would ever be admitted to the EU in the first place.

In Timișoara, Emil Esanu has seen the benefits of this transformative period first hand. “Immediately after joining the EU,” he says, “Romania started flourishing.” The country, he continues, has benefited immensely from EU infrastructure funding, EU-enabled investment, and later, Covid relief funds. For most of the 2010s, there was a palpable sense of optimism among Romanians that things were getting better.

Timișoara, a former Habsburg city in Western Romania and ground zero for the 1989 revolution against Ceaușescu, is in many ways the poster child for European integration. Now the capital of one of Romania’s wealthier provinces, Timisoara’s current mayor is Dominic Fritz, a German citizen who volunteered in the city as a teenager and returned in 2019, becoming Romania’s only non-citizen mayor a year later.

Despite recent progress, Esanu still worries about the decision to bar Georgescu from running. “You cannot throw a guy from the competition simply because you don’t like him,” he says. “Democracy means people should decide, not the constitutional court.”

Critics of right-wing populism have coined the term “managed democracy” to describe the process by which conservative ruling parties limit the opposition’s opportunities to take power without formally ending elections. In neighboring Hungary, Viktor Orbán is often accused of pioneering this approach. By disqualifying Georgescu, Romania’s constitutional court seems to be experimenting with managed democracy from the center. Since the court issued its final decision, few concrete details have emerged about Georgescu’s alleged connections to Russia. At the time of the court’s original ruling in November, the New York Times concluded, “Intelligence documents released publicly by Romania provided no evidence of a Russian role.”

For many Romanians, Georgescu and his supporters threaten the hard-won gains the country has made since the end of communism. Despite his avuncular persona and popularity on TikTok, Georgescu has indulged in conspiracy theories, spoken favorably of fascist politicians from the interwar era, and called for referendums on Romania’s membership in NATO and the European Union.

On Saturday, March 15, pro-EU and anti-Georgescu protesters rallied at the Piața Victoriei in downtown Bucharest. The demonstration was watched by a large contingent of local police and the Jandarmeria, Romania’s counter-terrorism force, probably because Georgescu supporters had clashed with police the previous weekend.

Despite the heavy police presence, the mood of the crowd was cheery. Families with young children bought EU and Romanian flags from circulating peddlers, who were drawn mainly from Romania’s large Roma minority and seemed uninterested in their customer’s political sympathies. In the background, speakers played local folk and rock music. A woman with a microphone briefly led the crowd in chants of “Yes Europe, no dictator!”

In the midst of the rally, a volunteer named Antonia Babeș kindly explained the meaning of a Romanian flag with a hole in the middle carried by one of the demonstrators. It’s a symbol of the 1989 revolution, she said, when anti-Ceaușescu protesters removed the emblem of the hated communist regime from the center of the flag.

Babeș was 8 years old when Ceaușescu was deposed and vividly remembers seeing blood on the streets from revolutionary violence. Now she has two young daughters and worries about their future in Romania, as well as more prosaic issues, like how much time they spend on their phones. Romania, she says, has been dealt a bad hand by geography and history. “It’s the East of the West,” she adds laughingly. Thi is is why she was so concerned about Georgescu’s promises to hold referendums on Romania’s NATO and EU membership.

Despite her strong desire to see Romania remain part of what she calls the “European family,” Babeș understands Georgescu’s appeal to certain voters. Georgescu, she explains, conveyed a message of respect to many Romanians. “He put us on a pedestal,” she says.

Like Esanu, Babeș also worries about the lack of evidence behind the constitutional court’s decision. “It was the right decision, but they weren’t transparent,” she says.

Elsewhere in the crowd, a group of younger protesters were more comfortable with the constitutional court’s ruling. “We all work for multinationals,” says a young woman named Elena, who speaks English with the easy fluency of someone who has grown up on Western news and pop culture. She was at the protest with her boyfriend Catalin, who honed his English skills by working as a lifeguard in Herndon, Virginia before returning to Bucharest.

Another protester named Julian carried an EU flag and was upset by the latest news from Washington, especially Vance’s decision to weigh in on Romanian politics. He was joined by his Dutch girlfriend Joyce, who has lived in Romania for years and speaks the language fluently. Earlier generations of left-wing protesters were typically skeptical of globalization and big corporations, but these marchers freely described themselves as “pro-corporate.” For Elena, Joyce, Catalin, and Julian, international investment enabled by EU integration has brought jobs, economic opportunities, and social progress to Romania. By promising referendums on EU and NATO membership, Georgescu threatens these hard-won gains. All four said they thought about leaving the country if Georgescu won.

In many ways, Romania’s problems are merely heightened versions of the same issues that confront other Western democracies. Just as Romania’s recent history has amplified anti-system politics, the country’s bumpy free market transition has intensified the problems of social and economic inequality. In modern Bucharest, hypercapitalism is in abundant evidence amid the remnants of the old regime. Casino and online gaming advertisements are ubiquitous—the Romanian-Canadian poker player Daniel Negreanu is a favored pitchman—and BMWs, Mercedes, and Porsches seem to be everywhere. A gleaming new office building advertises a “Crypto ATM” next to a dilapidated apartment complex. Some surviving historic buildings have been beautifully renovated; others are falling apart at the seams. In what’s left of Bucharest’s historic old town, sad-eyed girls try to lure British stag parties to restaurants, bars, and strip clubs. A homeless man sleeps under a freshly-painted mural of Frida Kahlo, who seems to have achieved memetic fame throughout Eastern Europe for reasons that remain obscure.

The conflict between traditional political parties and anti-establishment figures is not unique to Romania. In the liberal West, establishment organs rely on softer methods to marginalize anti-establishment leaders and causes. In the 2020 American presidential election, 50 former senior intelligence officials tried to discredit material recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop as a ploy by Russian intelligence. In Germany, the old center-right and center-left cling to a “firewall” to prevent the hard right Alternativ für Deutschland party from joining a governing coalition. Despite securing record-setting vote totals in the 2024 French parliamentary elections, the conservative Rassemblement National party is still kept out of government by means of a “cordon sanitaire.” Just as Romania’s transition to market democracy has been characterized by extremes, its political establishment’s response to Georgescu is merely blunter than the methods used in other countries.

Meanwhile, life goes on in Bucharest. Despite brief clashes between angry Georgescu supporters and Romanian police and an abundance of heated rhetoric on social media, the chances of another 1989-style uprising are remote. For all its faults, modern Romania is undeniably more prosperous, more modern, and more open than a generation ago.

Below the surface, however, larger issues loom. After the election, “I stopped watching,” says Dragos. “My friends said they’re not going to vote anymore.” Alex also says he’s stopped paying attention to politics. While many Romanians are relieved to have Georgescu out of the picture, others are disillusioned by the constitutional court’s heavy-handed intervention.

Just after the constitutional court issued its ruling, Georgescu cryptically announced that his mission had been fulfilled. His ideological lane has since been filled by George Simion, a younger right-wing politician who espouses similar views but seems to lack Georgescu’s paternal charisma. Crin Antonescu, whose uninspiring visage is plastered on posters throughout downtown Bucharest, is the unity candidate for another unwieldy centrist coalition called the “Romania Forward Electoral Alliance.” To reach young voters, Antonescu recently announced his plans to launch a podcast.

Outsiders may scoff at Georgescu’s outrageous statements, but every 21st-century democracy has been roiled by growing skepticism of official pronouncements and distrust of key institutions. These trends are particularly evident in a country like Romania, where the past several decades have instilled a deep distrust in the political system. For years, this credibility crisis was assumed to be a distinctly Eastern European phenomenon, a lingering hangover from the Cold War that would eventually pass. Now, however, trust in institutions has eroded everywhere while social media continues to eat away at the credibility of politicians, experts, and other authority figures. Once an outlier relegated to Europe’s cultural and political periphery, Romania is no longer lagging behind its Western counterparts. Instead, it looks like a harbinger of political dysfunction to come.",Right

Not to anyone who has studied U.S. trade policy. As the seminal authority on trade, the former Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, recently put it to Tucker Carlson: “If we just do zero for zero, we’re going to get wiped out. We’re going to end up with nothing, because we don’t have the structure to compete on that basis.”

Lighthizer is correct. For over a century, U.S. tariff acts have empowered presidents to adjust tariffs to “non-tariff barriers” that effectively discriminate against U.S. exports. None of it works. Setting tariffs in reaction to policies in other countries doesn’t work, as demonstrated through generations of U.S. trade policy. The historical lessons from reciprocity efforts show much more pernicious effects on the domestic zeitgeist, and that reciprocity is incompatible with a pro-tariff policy of protection and revenue.

Reciprocity is immoral, anticompetitive, and leads to the foreign entanglements President George Washington cautioned against. Its ill effects were best summed up in 1903 by a statement of principles adopted by the American Protective Tariff League:

Reciprocity in competitive products by treaty is unsound in principle, pernicious in practice, and is contrary alike to the principle of protection, to the fair treatment of domestic producers, and to the friendly relations with foreign countries. Reciprocity is neither ethical nor economic, since it seeks to benefit some industries by the sacrifice of others, which is the essence of injustice. As at present advocated, reciprocity is a policy of favoritism. It would tend to array industry against industry and section against section at home, and forment industrial retaliation and political antagonism abroad. Such a policy would open the door to the grossest favoritism in legislation, promote the growth of a corrupting lobby, and increase the power of debasing bossism. Such a policy has no justification in economics, statesmanship, ethics, or good politics. True American policy is protection of all the opportunities and possibilities of the American market for American enterprise, and fair, equal treatment for all other countries, namely the equal right to compete for American business in the American market by the payment of American wages. This alone is honest protection, good Republicanism, and the true American Policy.

Unfortunately, the League’s cautionary warnings failed to carry the day. But history has since proved them right.

What are tariffs for? The first Congress of the United States provided their answer in the first sentence of the first Tariff Act, passed July 4, 1789:

Whereas it is necessary for the support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufacturers, that duties be laid on goods, wares, and merchandise imported.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick know this history. Both men spoke during the campaign—at length, and in front of hostile audiences—about the importance of tariffs for revenue and protection.

Revenue and protection are not incompatible goals for tariff policy. Since the dawn of civilization, tariff schedules—lists of tariff rates for every imaginable product—have been posted at every civilization’s ports.

Some products’ tariff rates will have a revenue effect, some will have a protective effect, and some rates produce a bit of both for a given product. You can even enjoy both revenue and protective tariff rates on a single product through the use of what are called tariff rate quotas (TRQs). With a TRQ, you have an “in-quota” rate that can be a revenue tariff, and then an “over-quota” rate that is protective.

Tariffs were the preferred form of state revenue through most of history, including in the United States. In 1815, Congress asked Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas to propose a budget for the United States, with instructions that two-thirds of the needed $24 million in federal revenue come from tariffs. Dallas returned a detailed memorandum guiding on how to use tariffs for revenue and protection, which informed the “Dallas Tariff” (Tariff Act of 1816) and created a lasting template for U.S. tariffs for generations. Nowhere were preferential tariff rates for certain countries contemplated.

In March 1824, when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Henry Clay would go on to give one of the most famous speeches in Congressional history. Rejecting the premise that reciprocity would ever be possible with a foreign nation, Clay went to pains to demonstrate the futility of counting on export markets, especially for agricultural producers. Clay launched what became known as “the American System”: a combination of protective tariffs, federal funding for internal improvements, and a central bank.

The Whig Party, followed by the Republican Party, would largely carry on the American System into the 20th century. The United States would implement only two “reciprocal tariff” treaties between 1789 and 1891, and both provide cautionary lessons for today.

In 1854, like a bully pawning off a homework assignment to a weaker student, Britain successfully brow-beat the United States into its first “reciprocal” tariff agreement, a list of duty-free Canadian commodities. This treaty also involved plans for the U.S. annexation of Canada and a subsequent drive to replace America’s first income tax with tariffs, making it remarkably timely.

The story begins almost a decade before the treaty’s ratification, after the British Parliament infamously embraced free-trade policy with repeal of the “corn laws.” With Britain’s tariff on corn mostly abolished, and the tariff on lumber cut in half, Canada’s exports to her mother country collapsed. British merchants abandoned Canada for grain from the Danube and lumber from the Baltic.

Canadians were in trouble. On May 12, 1846, the Canadian parliament passed a resolution asking Britain to open negotiations with the United States for a reciprocal tariff treaty for Canada. Recognizing the distress in Canada, Britain authorized the Canadian provinces to set their own tariff rates. Canada promptly equalized its tariffs for the UK and U.S., seen as a necessary first step to preferential rates with the United States.

The British and Canadian legislatures felt they had a solid chance. The United States had maintained protectionist tariffs for most of the preceding decades back to the repeal of Jefferson’s Embargo Acts. This changed when Democrats replaced the Whig’s protectionist Tariff of 1842 with the “Walker Tariff” of 1846, named after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Walker. The Walker Tariff reduced rates on all products and completely eliminated “specific tariffs,” which are assessed on volume (that is, so many dollars per unit), not the importer’s declared value. With the Walker Tariff, all tariff rates were reverted to simple ad valorem percentages, assessed on whatever invoice the importer provides. Using ad valorem instead of specific tariffs typically substitutes protection for revenue. As Clay remarked at the time, “It is evident that on the ad-valorem principle, it is the foreigner who virtually fixes the actual amount of the duty paid. It is the foreigner who, by fixing that value, virtually legislates for us—and that in a case where his interest is directly opposed to that of our revenue.”

Despite the less protectionist Congress and the receptive Walker, there was insufficient interest in Washington to generate the momentum necessary for a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada. In 1848, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House, but stalled.

The economic situation continued to deteriorate in Canada. Lord Elgin, Canada’s governor general, wrote to the colonial minister that “property in most of the Canadian towns, and more especially in the capital, has fallen fifty per cent in value within the last three years. Three-fourths of the commercial men are bankrupt, owing to free-trade.”

Despite the dire situation in Canada, Britain proceeded to repeal her navigation laws, a significant blow to the maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, which made use of preferential cabotage to promote a Canadian carrying and shipbuilding industry.

Then, in late 1849, just as Congress was preparing to address slavery in the Mexican Cession, a dramatic development in Canada grabbed headlines: A group of prominent Montrealers published the Montreal Annexation Manifesto, calling for the peaceful separation of the Province of Canada from Britain and union with the United States​. This declaration sent shockwaves through the political press on both sides of the border.

The manifesto laid blame on Britain’s embrace of global free trade for making U.S. annexation necessary: “The reversal of the ancient policy of Great Britain, whereby she withdrew from the colonies their wonted protection in her markets, has produced the most disastrous effects upon Canada. In surveying the actual condition of the country, what but ruin or rapid decay meets the eye.”

Britain’s response? To stiffen her resolve and strengthen free trade by creating a new export market for Canadian products through a “reciprocal” trade deal with the United States.

It was very much a stick-and-carrot approach, heavy on the stick. On July 5, 1852, Britain sent a communication to the United States announcing that ships from the Royal Navy had been dispatched to assert fishing rights in a disputed 1818 treaty. American fishing vessels found violating Britain’s interpretation of the treaty would be seized. The United States sent Commodore Matthew Perry and the steam frigate Mississippi in response, but finding six armed British cruisers, the Maine and Massachusetts fishermen retreated.

The message was received; it was known in Washington “that Great Britain would not consider the settlement of the fishery question aside from reciprocal trade.”

Britain’s fisheries gambit was further aided by the Southern delegation in Congress, which was alarmed at the prospect of Canada joining the United States as a non-slave state. According to Republican Senators Jacob Collamer of Vermont and Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, “apprehension on the part of the South, in 1854, was what brought about the treaty.”

On June 5, 1854, Britain succeeded. U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy and Elgin signed the Reciprocity Treaty. It provided for the mutual enjoyment of the Atlantic coast fisheries north of the 36th parallel, reciprocal free trade in a number of agricultural commodities, and gave the United States free navigation of the St. Lawrence River and of the Canadian canals.

As would become the pattern throughout American history, however, the “reciprocal tariff” agreement benefited the other country at America’s expense. Representative Frederick Pike, a Republican from Maine, in a speech to Congress in 1862, laid out the results: “In 1854, we exported about three dollars for one of imports, and now, in the last two years, have imported about a million and a half more than our exports.”

Pike described the immoral nature of how the reciprocity treaty pitted producers and states against each other: “Massachusetts was willing to sacrifice the interests of Maine, if thereby she could get the cheap wood of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.”

Pike condemned the foreign influence and money behind the reciprocity campaign: “It is well known that Canada spent considerable sums to aid in lubricating [the treaty’s] passage through the channels of official routine in this city.” Even today, the government of Canada continues to spend money throughout the United States attacking U.S. tariffs.

By 1864, Canadian exports to the United States benefiting from duty-free treatment were double that of the United States to Canada.

Ultimately, what would kill the Reciprocity Treaty would be its interference with much-needed tariffs for revenue. Congress had passed the first federal income tax in 1862, which managed to provide for nearly a quarter of the Civil War’s revenue, despite relying on voluntary compliance. But by 1864, the United States was $2.6 billion in debt with only $858,309 of cash on hand.

Revenue was needed, and Republicans were particularly incensed that reciprocity with Canada compelled the Treasury to forgo tariff revenue while collecting a domestic income tax: “There existed a feeling that the American producer should not be loaded with taxes, while at the same time the Canadian producer, who competed with him, contributed nothing to the revenue of our Government.” Several senators made statements in the chamber decrying the admission of duty-free imports while a domestic income tax system existed. Chandler said:

The citizens of Michigan are largely taxed for the support of this Government, taxed directly and indirectly ; taxed upon their income, and upon their products, and upon their consumption ; taxed in every way, while the inhabitants of Canada raise precisely the same articles, are engaged in the same business, and send their products here to compete with ours without contributing one dollar to the support of this Government.

At the end of the Civil War, Congress voted to give the one year’s notice per the treaty’s terms to withdraw, and on March 17, 1866, the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada was terminated.

The termination would prove a happy ending for both the United States and Canada. The following year, on July 1, 1867, realizing they could count on neither Britain nor the United States, the British provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick united into one federation called the Dominion of Canada. Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A. MacDonald, would go on to implement Henry Clay’s American System for British North America. His government campaigned on a “National Policy” that embraced protective tariffs and Canada’s own transcontinental railway. The United States and Canada would spend the rest of the 19th century rapidly industrializing, raising the standard of living in both countries ahead of Europe, all under their respective protectionist tariffs. And indeed, by 1911, Canada out-protectionismed America, rejecting a second reciprocity treaty that year that had been pushed by the United States.

The Kingdom of Hawaii had first proposed a reciprocity treaty with the United States in 1855, but the effort was plagued with similar problems to Canada’s advocacy and did not benefit from the extra push by Britain.

Still, while the Canada Treaty was adopted partially by interests in both Washington and London on quelling annexation talk, the same cannot be said of Hawaiian reciprocity. As Senator Justin Morrill (R-VT) said in a March 18, 1875 speech, “The most potent argument now offered [in support of Hawaiian reciprocity] is the same suggestion that has heretofore been most prominently presented, as in 1855 and 1869, namely, that if we do not make this arrangement—so feeble are their numbers, so lamentably deficient are their resources—they will be compelled to lean upon some other power. Great Britain or New Zealand will snatch them up and they will be lost to us forever.”

Morrill still cautioned about the bad precedent of Republicans supporting a reciprocal tariff deal: “What may be done with King Kalakaua may be done with the Queen of Great Britain or the Autocrat of Russia.”

The Hawaiians (or more accurately, the sugar-plantation owners) were ultimately successful, with Hawaiian tariff-free reciprocity effective September 9, 1876. Joseph Nāwahī, a Hawaiian legislator, publicly predicted that the treaty would be “a nation-snatching treaty,” stating, “The Treaty of Reciprocity becoming law will be the first step of annexation later on, and the kingdom, its flag, its independence and its people will become naught.”

A modern observer may readily conclude that this treaty was a “success” insofar as Hawaii is now a U.S. state. After all, if reciprocity is a mere prelude to annexation, then ultimately, reciprocity is not incompatible with tariffs for revenue and protection.

But this glosses over the history and chronology. The annexation of Hawaii was not a smooth commercial union akin to the Alaska Purchase of 1867. As Congress would acknowledge in the Apology Resolution of 1993, the Kingdom of Hawaii was “overthrown” (Congress’s words) with U.S. military support.

Whether reciprocity was a necessary stepping stone to annexation is beyond the scope of this article. But a few observations are warranted. Reciprocity’s overwhelming benefit to Hawaii was for Hawaiian sugar exports, and on the American side, to sugar refiners in San Francisco. But there were losers: namely sugar-cane plantations in Louisiana and Florida, and western sugar-beet farmers, who were supplying approximately one-tenth of U.S. demand.

And as always, hard lessons were learned about the inadvisability of international supply chains. After the Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty was ratified, between 1875 and 1890, U.S. consumption of Hawaiian sugar increased over 1,400 percent, cementing Hawaii’s economic dependence on U.S. exports. But in 1890, Congress was flush with more revenue than Congress knew what to do with. William McKinley, then chairman of the U.S. Ways and Means Committee, wanted to increase tariffs on manufactured goods, but was under tremendous pressure to offset those tariff increases with tariff cuts elsewhere. McKinley chose sugar, eliminating the tariff of two cents per pound (64 cents per pound today). Hawaii’s duty-free concession on sugar was now worthless, devastating Hawaii economically. U.S. sugar importers immediately switched to Cuba, while American planters in Hawaii set about plotting the overthrow of the queen.

Shortly after their successful revolution, the United States restored the sugar duty in 1894, seriously damaging Cuba’s newfound prosperity. Per the tariff historian John Dobson, “In a few months, Cuban revolutionaries had capitalized on the discontent of the impoverished Cuban peasants and had renewed a bloody fight for independence begun 25 years before. This conflict ultimately drew the United States into a war with Spain in 1898… Thus, the seemingly innocent juggling of the sugar duty had important consequences for the United States and for the world.”

Ultimately, McKinley’s 1890 nullification of Hawaiian reciprocity seems to have been a necessary step towards the country’s annexation.

A leading figure drawing the Republican Party, and the United States, away from isolationism and defense of the home market above all was James Blaine. A Congressman for Maine, Blaine was elected as Speaker of the House for the 41st Congress beginning in 1869. After President Ulysses Grant selected the protectionist Morrill to be his treasury secretary, Blaine was appointed to Morrill’s Senate seat. Blaine, like the rest of Maine’s delegation, had been opposed to the reciprocity treaty with Canada, but his views changed. Nominated by President James Garfield to be secretary of state in 1881, Blaine embraced reciprocal trade as a means to get ahead of European involvement in the Western Hemisphere. He negotiated tariff reciprocity treaties with Mexico in 1882, and with the Dominican Republic and Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico) in 1884. Nevertheless, protectionists in the Senate managed to stall consideration of Blaine’s treaties. None would be implemented.

International intrigue resulting from the Tariff Act of 1890 did not end with sugar and Hawaii. The Republican Party was now splitting into factions, those singularly focused on protecting the home market versus those led by Blaine who saw reciprocity as a means to create an American empire.

After the Democratic interlude of President Grover Cleveland’s first term, Blaine returned as secretary of state in 1890, convening the First International Conference of American States as one of his first orders of business. Blaine went so far as to push for a hemispheric customs union at the conference, but the idea had little support in Congress or from the other countries.

Nevertheless, in Congress, Blaine would win an important battle against McKinley that would cement reciprocity’s future ruination of protection. During congressional consideration of the Tariff Act of 1890, Blaine was victorious against McKinley over the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in the Tariff Act of 1890 (hereinafter, the Blaine Clause).

The Blaine Clause did seem innocent enough. While McKinley’s Tariff eliminated the duty on sugar, molasses, tea, coffee, and hides, Blaine’s Clause authorized the President to reinstate the tariffs against countries that treated U.S. exports in a “reciprocally unequal and unreasonable” fashion. McKinley, known as the “Napoleon of Protection”, opposed the Blaine Clause as an improper delegation of congressional authority. President Benjamin Harrison, however, sided with Blaine, which secured Blaine’s reciprocity clause in the Senate version of the bill, despite McKinley’s resistance. The so-called “McKinley Tariff” would become famous for containing the Blaine Clause despite McKinley’s opposition.

Blaine, by all accounts a master orator, was successful in persuading even some ardent protectionists that reciprocity was compatible with protection. In October 1890, the American Protective Tariff League published a column quoting from a speech Blaine gave in Canton, with the writer saying it “discredits forever and absolutely the Free Trade statements that Mr. Blaine had become indifferent to Protection, or personally hostile to members of the Republican party who did not accept or approve of his views upon Reciprocity.” The column assured protectionists that Blaine would only sacrifice revenue-tariffs (tariffs on certain commodities for which we were import-dependent) to promote exports, and never protective tariffs. This seems impossible to square with Blaine’s desire for a hemispheric customs union.

Marketing reciprocity as compatible with protection would be a major rhetorical strategy for globalist Republicans in the following decades.

Between 1891 and 1892, under Harrison, Blaine used his clause to secure 10 reciprocity treaties. Key agreements included those with Brazil, Spain (for Cuba and Puerto Rico), and several Latin American nations like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

Blaine did not think annexation of all these countries was worthwhile. He genuinely believed in promoting international trade in the Western Hemisphere for its own sake, for the promotion of foreign entanglements. Blaine wrote privately to Harrison that only Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico “are of value enough to be taken.”

These reciprocity agreements set a terrible precedent, as unlike the Canada and Hawaii treaties, these new ones were not “treaties” per the Constitution's Treaty Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2). They did not require Senate approval, a novel executive power shift. The president would merely be using the Blaine Clause’s delegated power from Congress. This clause was challenged in court by an importer forced to pay duties per the President’s invocation of the clause, but the clause was upheld by unanimous Supreme Court judgment in Field v. Clark (1892).

Blaines’s treaties were immediately followed by the Panic of 1893, and Blaine’s health rapidly declined, leading to his death that year. Democrats dismantled McKinley’s tariff, replacing it with their Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, effectively nullifying Blaine’s agreements and removing the clause.

The 1896 Republican Party platform declared “Protection and Reciprocity are twin measures.” And McKinley’s views on reciprocity, or at least the president’s use of tariff powers, had apparently changed by 1896 as he ran for the White House. In a recorded campaign speech from 1896, he declared, “Our creed embraces an honest dollar, an untarnished national credit, adequate revenues for the uses of the government, protection to labor and industry, preservation of the home market, and reciprocity which will extend our foreign markets.”

History has proven that protection and reciprocity are not, in fact, twin measures, or at all compatible, as Clay had so eloquently demonstrated back in 1824.

But the 1896 Republican Party had clearly subordinated the home market emphasis, despite still giving it a nod. The platform continued:

Resolved, That we favor such reciprocity measures as will enable the United States to secure a proper share of the markets of the world for the products of our labor and our manufactures, and to that end we favor the cession of our right to impose retaliatory duties upon the importations from any country which imposes unequal or discriminating duties upon the products of American labor or manufactures.

McKinley’s 1897 Dingley Tariff Act raised duties to a record 57 percent, yet included a reciprocity provision allowing negotiated trade deals. Treaties with France and others followed, though protectionism still held sway. Nelson Aldrich, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, championed protection, at least rhetorically.

By 1901, McKinley’s final speech—days before his assassination—pushed further, advocating tariff flexibility to boost exports. Theodore Roosevelt, succeeding him, initially maintained this balance. His administration negotiated reciprocity with Cuba in 1902, cutting duties by 20 percent, but faced resistance from protectionist “Old Guard” Republicans.

With the rise of the giant American “trusts” (monopolies and oligopolies) during this period, public sympathy for tariff protection was at a low. While the same Republican congress that had passed the McKinley Tariff of 1890 also passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, Republican presidents had failed to adequately make use of its antitrust authorities. In retrospect, failure to more vigorously enforce the Sherman Act surely led to the destruction of protection.

William Howard Taft’s presidency (1909–1913) marked the peak of this tension. The 1909 Payne-Aldrich Tariff aimed to lower rates, but Senate revisions led by Aldrich kept duties high (averaging 40 percent), alienating progressive Republicans who favored reciprocity and reform.

Cementing the shift in thinking, it was now Republicans pushing for reciprocity even with Canada. Taft’s push for a Canadian reciprocity agreement in 1911—proposing mutual tariff cuts—split the party. Progressives like Robert La Follette backed it for cheaper goods and markets, while protectionists saw it as betrayal. It was Canada’s rejection in 1911, fearing U.S. dominance, that killed the deal.

By 1912, the Republican split deepened. Roosevelt ran as a Progressive, splitting the vote and giving Democrats a trifecta with uber-globalist Woodrow Wilson as President. The 1912 Democratic Party Platform led with the proposition that protectionist tariffs were actually unconstitutional, a long since discredited argument made by Confederates decades earlier.

President Woodrow Wilson wasted no time working with the “Father of the Income Tax,” Cordell Hull, then a Tennessee congressman at Ways and Means, to eviscerate America’s longstanding protective tariff. They did so with their radical Revenue Act of 1913, drastically slashing tariffs and substituting that revenue with the new income tax and Internal Revenue Service. The protective tariff was now fully destroyed.

The First World War temporarily held off a flood of imports. When that surge did take off in 1919, wiping out American farmers, Democrats were eviscerated at the polls. In 1920, the GOP swept Congress and the presidency. The 67th Congress wasted no time in restoring tariffs for revenue and protection with the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921 and then the more sweeping Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922. The 1922 bill did a number of things:

It raised tariffs on a wide range of goods, including chinaware, pig iron, textiles, sugar, and rails, restoring duties to the high levels of 1907.

It increased tariffs from 60 to 400 percent on dyes, chemicals, silk and rayon textiles, and hardware;

The average ad valorem tariff rate for dutiable imports rose to about 38.5 percent

It was an incredible success. In 1923, tariff revenue surged to over $582 million, an increase of more than $200 million from the Democrats’ tariff. The Roaring ‘20s ensued:

Gross National Product from 1923 to 1928 grew roughly three percent annually;

The national war debt by was shrunk 34 percent;

By 1927 the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent, and

Significantly for the Trump administration, income tax was eliminated for 98 percent of the population.

Trump is serious about renewing this success. He has discussed using tariffs to replace the income tax with Congressional Republicans, although as of March 2025, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader John Thune have not shown much tariff ambition. On the revenue side, the Trump administration aims to raise anywhere from $400 billion to $1 trillion per year, and on the protection side, he has increased tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, and is poised to do so on copper and copper articles, lumber and wood articles, and medicines. On March 3, 2025, Trump channeled Clay’s American System speech from March 1824, pledging protection of the home market to American farmers. On March 12, 2025, when asked by host Stuart Varney on Fox Business’s Varney & Co. about the administration’s tariff strategy, Lutnick said, “The president is here to protect American workers. He’s here to protect American industry.”

The president has marked April 2 as Liberation Day, promising sweeping new tariffs for revenue. As of March 31, according to the Wall Street Journal, Trump has pushed his cabinet to embrace the “universal” tariffs he campaigned on, as opposed to country-specific reciprocal tariffs. This further evidences Trump’s bona-fide protectionist instincts.

The 1922 Tariff Act contained eight “reciprocity” provisions tied to specific products. Notably, Title I, Sec. 1, Par. 369 of the Act set the tariff on cars at 25 percent, much as Trump has just done. Paragraph 369 also mandated that if any other country charges more than 25 percent, then the United States will impose the same tariff as that country, up to a rate of 50 percent.

Title III, Sec. 315 the 1922 Tariff also gave the president broad authority to increase tariffs on any country if that country was found to discriminate against American exports in any manner.

While the United States had dabbled in “reciprocity” for a handful of commodities with a handful of countries, mostly for short periods of time, these were aberrations. Per a Senate finance report, “The United States consistently applied a single-schedule tariff to imports from all countries. Reciprocal treaties granting reductions from the general tariff rates were few in number at any given time.”

During the 1920s, Cordell Hull was, unfortunately, still ascendant, preparing to seal America’s subsequent ruin. He became chairman of the Democratic National Committee as well as a champion of America’s international creditors. Hull attacked the Fordney tariff on the basis that protective tariffs were making it harder for overseas vendors to export to America, and thus harder for them to earn dollars to repay their debts. He also attacked the settlements of debts owed to U.S. lenders that involved lenders accepting less profit.

Hull and his companions around the world who put creditors ahead of producers helped not only lay the foundation for the Great Depression, but exacerbated it. While the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 has been long defamed as playing a role in the Great Depression, no less than the former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other leading economic historians have “largely blamed that catastrophe on the international gold standard.” As Ben Stein noted in the New York Times, “exports were only about 5 percent of the economic output of the United States… To say that the [Smoot-Hawley] Act, which applied to a distinct minority of imports and which raised tariffs generally by only about six percentage points, caused the Depression is almost comical.”

Nonetheless, with the Depression in full effect, Democrats swept Congress and the Presidency in 1932. Hull now represented Tennessee in the Senate.

Look in any textbook or ask any AI, and you can learn about the “Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.” In fact, there was no such legislation. What actually happened is that Democrats amended the Tariff Act of 1930 (Smoot-Hawley) with legislation titled “An Act to Promote Foreign Trade.”

Much like with Blaine’s 1890 clause, it allowed the president to adjust tariff rates based on mere “executive agreement” (no Senate ratification necessary). But that’s where the similarities ended. Hull’s 1934 amendment (hereinafter the Hull Clause) allowed the president to eliminate duties on any item, and worse yet, cemented an “Unconditional Most Favored Nation (MFN) Principle.”

Lest there be any doubt about the motivations, Section 3 of the Hull Clause stated that “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to give any authority to cancel or reduce, in any manner, any of the indebtedness of any foreign country to the United States.” Hull gave himself blanket authority to throw domestic producers under the bus so that foreign countries could export more to earn more dollars to repay their debts. But not a single dollar of that indebtedness was to be forgiven.

Hull’s clause permanently launched the presidential tariff era, and to this day Congress has not passed a Tariff Act since 1930.

The Hull Clause stated that any tariff cuts proclaimed by the president “shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly” (emphasis added). This is known as “Unconditional MFN,” which applies tariff reductions made to one trade partner to all countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. Whereas under the Blaine Clause a tariff cut for Brazil was just that, a tariff cut for Brazil, under the Hull Clause the tariff cuts for the 1935 “Reciprocal” Trade Agreement with Brazil applied to virtually the entire world.

In the subsequent decade, Hull, now secretary of state, entered into 30 trade agreements with 29 foreign nations (he did Canada twice), each one cutting U.S. tariffs globally and on a non-reciprocal basis. This was the end of America’s protective tariff.

Hull’s tariff cuts really did apply globally: the Japanese Empire, Nazi Germany, it made no difference. Hull was virulently anti-tariff, and nothing was more important than lenders foreign debts being repaid through exports back to America.

The Hull Clause did contemplate other countries using “non-tariff barriers” to thwart American exports. It authorized the president to “suspend the application [of the tariff cut to] any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce.” Presidents have had all the tools necessary to deal with lack of genuine reciprocity, but until President Trump, all were overwhelmingly reluctant to use those powers.

After the war, in 1947, Hull’s 30 trade agreements were collapsed into the global General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a non-reciprocal tariff agreement with 22 other nations.

By 1950, the average rate of duty paid on goods imported into the U.S. had fallen to 5.8 percent, and 60 percent of all goods were imported duty-free. Imports from the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc became a bridge too far, however. Trade policy was in the service of international lenders, but now also in fighting international communism. President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951. The American tariff schedule was split into “Column 1” and “Column 2.” Column 1 contained negligible tariffs for GATT countries and other non-communist countries, while Column 2 contained higher rates from the Tariff Act of 1930. Section 5 of the 1951 Act directed that communist nations be moved to Column 2. Column 1 and 2 remain today, but as of March 2025, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, and Russia are the only countries in Column 2.

Congress did get wise to the lack of reciprocity at the outset of the GATT “Tokyo Round” in the early 1970s. Industries from flatware to bicycles had largely been wiped out, with temporary GATT-authorized “safeguard” tariffs only slowing the bleed-out. Congress legislated “Reciprocal nondiscriminatory treatment” as part of the Trade Act of 1974, and it remains the law today (see 19 U.S. Code § 2136).

The president would only be allowed to proclaim the latest round of tariff cuts if he could certify that we had achieved reciprocity with Canada, Europe, and Japan. The president did so, and indeed, we got it. Ever since, Japan has charged zero tariffs on U.S. cars, while we have charged Japan 2.5 percent. Under this reciprocal regime, Japan sends us 77 cars for every one car we send them. And President Trump stands virtually alone inside the Beltway in identifying this first as a problem, and second as one that can be remedied through tariffs.",Right

Whether in buying Russian-produced S-400 air defense systems over Washington’s loud objections in 2020, triangulating between Ukraine and Russia since the latter invaded the former in 2022, supporting Azerbaijan’s brutal offensive against Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh (“Artsakh”) in 2023, or intervening in Syria against Bashar Assad’s regime, Turkey in the Erdoğan era appears to be acting as a proud and independent power, unconstrained by any loyalty to the U.S. or fidelity to the NATO alliance to which it still belongs—if not a revanchist regional bully.

After the toppling of Assad last December, headlines blared about Turkey’s intelligence chief praying at the famous Umayyad mosque in Damascus with cameras rolling. After the prayer, Turkish carpets were ostentatiously installed. It was hard to miss the note of alarm in a Hill headline on “Neo-Ottoman Turkey’s triumph over its regional rivals.” “Turkey,” Washington policy analyst Andrew Latham warned, “has carved out a new role for itself as successor to the Ottoman empire.”

To anyone familiar with history, however, Erdoğan’s increasingly assertive (and often U.S.-hostile or at least U.S.-indifferent) foreign policy should not be altogether surprising. If we take a longer view, the four decades during which Turkey was a loyal U.S. client state—between 1952 (when the nation joined NATO) and 1991 (when the USSR collapsed)—were a historical anomaly, arising from a combination of Turkey’s weakness, its hostility to the expansionist post-1945 Soviet Union, and its strategic location in the Cold War.

Despite the cultural modernization and westernization wrought by Atatürk’s reforms in the 1920s and 1930s, the rump Republican Turkey born of the violent collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War—its population reduced to under 15 million even as many of its most productive skilled workers, artisans, and engineers were lost in the population exchange with Greece in 1923—was demographically and economically moribund for decades. Turkey did not truly come roaring back to life until the pro-market reforms under Turgut Özal in the 1980s launched an economic and baby boom. Turkey’s population, having inched past 40 million in 1980, has since more than doubled, and its gross annual economic output, a mere $68 billion in 1980 even adjusted to today’s dollars, had tripled by the time Özal died in 1993. By 2023, it stood at $1.1 trillion.

It was no accident that the first sign of Turkey going its own way in foreign policy came in 1991, when Özal, despite being a U.S.-educated engineer who was generally pro-American, kept his distance from the victorious U.S.-led coalition in the First Gulf War, allowing the use of airbases in Turkey but contributing no troops or support personnel. The emergence of a Kurdish-dominated zone in the oil-rich region of northern Iraq under U.S. protection after that war confirmed Ankara’s worst fears. It gave spur to Turkey’s longtime domestic nemesis, the once Soviet-supported Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK, which scaled up its periodic acts of terror in southeastern Turkey into a full-blown insurgency in the 1990s. Although the U.S. government designated the PKK a terrorist organization in 1997, persistent American support for Iraq’s Kurds, including a heavily armed Kurdish security force called the Peshmerga, was hard for Turkish leaders to ignore.

The Second Gulf War of March 2003, meanwhile, nearly sundered U.S.-Turkish relations entirely. The timing was tricky, as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s new Justice and Development Party (AKP) had just swept to power in the November 2002 parliamentary election with a super-majority of 363 out of 550 seats—even though Erdoğan was in jail as the elections took place. He was behind bars for an explosive speech he had given back in 1997 citing an old poem, with certain lines (“minarets are our spears” and “mosques are our barracks”) seeming to violate Turkey’s strict constitutional restrictions on Islam in public life (laiklik or “laicism”), dating back to Mustafa Kemal’s postwar secular reforms. Owing to quiet U.S. diplomatic support during his years in prison, Erdoğan was believed to be more pro-American than the secularist politicians he had beaten—in fact many educated Turkish elites believed that Erdoğan, like the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen whose network of influential charter schools and media organizations helped elect him, was an American asset. (Gülen, if not Erdoğan, was undeniably U.S.-connected, at least since he had moved to the U.S. in 1999, setting up his international headquarters in the Pocono mountains of eastern Pennsylvania, almost halfway in between Washington and New York City; Gülen’s asylum papers were signed by Graham Fuller, a notorious CIA officer who had helped run the Afghan mujaheddin in the 1980s. Turkey’s secularist generals grumbled, not without reason, that Gülen was “America’s Frankenstein”).

On March 3, 2003 the Turkish parliament failed to approve U.S. use of Turkish bases or territory during “Operation Iraqi Freedom,” with 60 AKP deputies joining the opposition in an apparent political blow to Erdoğan (if his support for the U.S. and its allies in Iraq was indeed sincere, which in retrospect seems doubtful). The no vote plunged relations between Ankara and Washington into crisis mode, but few ordinary Turks seemed to mind. Once the Iraq war went sour, with a postwar insurgency bleeding American lives, treasure, and prestige, Turks all but reveled in Schadenfreude, best epitomized in the 2006 Turkish smash hit film Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak (“Valley of the Wolves: Iraq”), starring the mostly washed-up Hollywood Actor Gary Busey as a Jewish-American doctor who cuts out the organs of innocent Muslims at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison and ships them to the West for profit. By 2009, it was reported that less than 10 percent of Turks had a “favorable” view of the U.S., and no wonder.

Still, we should not overrate the importance of Turkish anti-Americanism, either in Turkey’s politics or its foreign policy. Despite surveys showing regularly that Turks have the most negative views of Americans of any country in the world, bottoming out around 2007–2009 before a brief upturn in the early Obama years, any American who traveled to the country even at the height of tensions over the Iraq war can attest that ordinary Turks are friendly and gracious hosts. What the slow-motion blow-up over Iraq (which began all the way back in 1991) revealed, rather, was that Turkey’s governing establishment was no longer beholden to Cold War precedent and tradition.

A significant departure came with Erdoğan’s assertion of authority over the Turkish “deep state” (derin devlet), which had seen Turkey’s Kemalist military establishment intervene whenever popular Islamic politicians seemed to threaten Kemal’s laicist constitution. The military staged actual coups in 1960 (when the elected president, Adnan Menderes, was arrested and executed) and 1980, and more recently pulled off a “soft” or “postmodern” coup against Necmettin Erbakan (who agreed to resign and stay out of politics for five years) in 1997, the same year Erdoğan was arrested over his incendiary poetry reading. Erdoğan, after coming to power in early 2003, was more careful than his predecessors had been. But he also had the Gülen network at his disposal, which had begun to seed the Turkish police, army, and intelligence service with young men educated in Gülenist charter schools, who were much friendlier to Islam than the old Kemalists. The critical break occurred in April 2007, on the eve of new elections. Erdoğan refused to blink when the chief of the Turkish General Staff, Yaşar Büyükanıt, issued a memorandum warning of “the erosion of basic values, primarily secularism.” Steeled by Erdoğan’s defiance, the AKP swept to its first popular majority (the 2002 elections had returned a parliamentary majority with only 37 percent of the vote), and the military did nothing.

Over the next half-decade, Erdoğan used a series of show trials against suspiciously large “deep state” cabals allegedly plotting terrible acts against the Turkish people (the first was called Ergenekon and the second Balyoz, or “Sledgehammer”). While a few Western reporters did offer critical coverage of the crackdown, most Western governments looked the other way from Erdoğan’s purges of “disloyal” Kemalists, in part because (especially in Europe) Turkey’s secularist deep state had long been resented for its hostility to Kurdish minorities and its often blatant interference in democratic politics. It was seen as now receiving its just deserts. Strange as it is to remember today after a decade of ham-handed authoritarian maneuvers, Erdoğan’s political triumph over the general staff in 2007 was celebrated by the left in both Turkey and Europe: He was a hero of “democracy.”

Erdoğan’s reputation in the West did not really begin to suffer until his tactical partnership with Gülen burst into rivalry and then open political war in 2013. Gülen’s press network turned on Erdoğan and blasted him with (mostly accurate) stories about corruption and nepotism, and in 2016 the Gülen network inside Turkey (Hizmet or, in its alleged military wing, FETÖ, or “Fethullist terrorist organization”) tried, or was goaded into, overthrowing Erdoğan’s government in a military coup. Launched on the night of July 15, 2016, the coup was a bitter and close-run affair, and its failure was a political triumph for Erdoğan. The U.S. government refused to extradite Gülen, even after Erdoğan tried playing hardball by cutting off power to the American airbase in southeastern Turkey at İncirlik. Still, the Gülenist network inside Turkey was smashed utterly, with Erdoğan opportunistically rehabilitating some of the old “Sledgehammer” generals he had arrested and forging a political alliance with the hard nationalist right out of shared antipathy to Gülen (and the PKK). Once seen as softer on the Kurds and more “democratic” than the secularist Turkish deep state, Erdoğan fully embraced his inner Turkish nationalist-authoritarian. Together with the brutal, extra-judicial crackdown on the Gülen network, which ensnared hundreds of Turkish academics and entire universities, journalists, and even hospitals, this hard right turn gravely eroded Erdoğan’s public image in the West.

Even as Erdoğan’s reputation abroad was darkening, Turkey began pushing its weight around again in the Middle East, in everything from interventions in the Syrian Civil War and post-Qaddafi Libya to ever-louder backing of the Palestinian cause and overt support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Sunni Islamist extremist groups like Hamas. Turkey has also made waves in the realm of soft power. Magnificent Century, a lurid soap opera nostalgia-fest for the Ottoman glory days of the 16th century set in the harem of Süleyman the Magnificent, became a smash hit across the greater Middle East and was later picked up by Netflix. In 2020, Erdoğan helped push through a court ruling turning the great Byzantine church the Hagia Sofia (Aya Sofya) into a mosque again, as it had been from the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 until Mustafa Kemal designated it a non-denominational museum and heritage site in 1934. Although Christians and Turkish secularists cried foul, the Aya Sofya mosque is now a far greater attraction than Kemal’s secular “museum” ever was, drawing in more than 50,000 visitors every day, the vast majority of them Muslim worshippers. It is now an important global pilgrimage site for Sunni Islam.

As for hard power, Turkish victories in the Erdoğan era initially seemed harder to come by, in part owing to the friction between Erdoğan and the military between the Büyükanıt showdown of 2007 and the thwarted Gülenist coup of 2016, which raised doubts about the army’s loyalty and cohesion. But the last few years have seen a revival here too, with victories by Turkish-armed clients—however costly in human terms—in Nagorno-Karabakh and Syria, and the well-publicized role of Turkish Bayraktar TB-2 drones in the Ukraine war. This March, Erdoğan announced a deal with the longtime PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, who has asked his followers to lay down their arms and dissolve the organization. If the deal holds, the PKK climbdown may be Erdoğan’s greatest geopolitical win yet, a blend of hard and soft power that signals a broader Turkish ascendancy across the contested Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and possibly Iran as well.

Is Erdoğan, then, a neo-Ottomanist trying to revive the old empire, as Washington’s Turkey-watchers have surmised? Certainly, nostalgia for the past helps to animate Turkish politics. But we must be careful not to exaggerate either Erdoğan’s ambitions or the means he has at his disposal to achieve them. Not unlike the Russia of Putin, his rival strongman whose alleged efforts to recreate the Soviet empire have been wildly overblown—Russian troops may have advanced steadily over the past year, but they are still in the far reaches of eastern Ukraine—the reach of Erdoğan’s Turkey is limited. He may now have genuine influence in Syria and over Hamas and other Sunni Muslim movements, and some diplomatic leverage in the Russia–Ukraine war. But the idea of today’s Turkey conquering Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and huge swathes of the Balkans, to recreate a simulacrum of the Ottoman empire circa 1900, is absurd on its face.

Of course, Ottoman diplomats were masters at overcoming apparent weakness and leveraging geography to survive, from goading Britain and France into attacking Russia on their behalf in the Crimean War of the 1850s, to getting Britain and Germany to force Russia to stand down in the war of 1877–78, when Russian troops reached San Stefano (Yesilköy) on the outskirts of today’s Istanbul, to the First World War, when the beleaguered and overmatched Ottomans nearly rode Germany’s coattails to an improbable victory. At the time of the Compiègne armistice of November 1918 on the western front, Turkish troops had taken Baku and were racing northwards up the Caspian Sea towards Black Earth Russia. In raw economic and demographic terms, Turkey is actually stronger today, vis-à-vis Europe, than the Ottoman empire was at any point after, say, the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, which began its long retreat from the Balkans. If Erdoğan’s own diplomats had the same savoir faire as their Ottoman predecessors, it would be easy to imagine Turkey dominating the greater Middle East today, even without direct sovereign control.

But in other ways the comparison is misleading. Europe today is hardly a hard power colossus. Even its wealthiest members, such as Germany, have none of the dynamism they did in the 19th and early 20th centuries, which made the Ottomans seem so moribund in comparison. Twenty years ago, Turkey was still straining, almost begging, to join the European Union, but today it might be better off staying out so as not to be weighed down by excessive regulation. Inflation may be far worse in Turkey than anywhere in Europe, but having an independent currency, however cheap and unstable, gives Erdoğan’s economic team more flexibility than Greece or other EU member states weighed down by the euro. Moreover, the weakness of the Turkish lira keeps the country relatively inexpensive for tourists, investors, and real estate buyers from the Arab world and Russian sphere, who appreciate the country’s beauty and temperate climate, which can be enjoyed for a bargain.

Turkey’s apparent resurgence in the Erdoğan era is relative, standing out due to the comparative decline of its neighbors, from the ever more sclerotic Eurozone to the wreckage in Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Despite recent growth, Turkey remains basically a middling regional power, its national economic output ranking a respectable 17th, though much lower in per capita terms (about 64th). Even Turkey’s recent geopolitical victories resulted from the accidental alignment of interests between Turkey, Israel, and the U.S. in Syria (at least in the Biden era, when the U.S. supported toppling Assad), and from Israel’s smashing, in the wake of Hamas’s October 2023 attacks, of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which gravely weakened Iran. A similar dynamic was on display in Israel’s support for the Turkish position in Azerbaijan against loosely Russia-aligned Armenia. By contrast, Erdoğan’s consistent advocacy for the return of Crimea to Ukraine is likely to go nowhere, as it not only runs up against firm Russian opposition, but likely exceeds what the U.S. is willing to stipulate.

Erdoğan’s recent successes, meanwhile, occurred at a time when the Turkish economy was still more or less intact before his latest ham-handed authoritarian maneuver: the shocking jailing and disqualification of the main opposition candidate, Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, from standing in the next presidential election. This sparked yet another run on the lira, which cost Turkey’s central bank $25 billion in just the first few days, and induced a market meltdown in perhaps the most serious financial crisis of the Erdoğan era to date. Whatever political capital Erdoğan may have gained from the Öcalan deal dissolving the PKK has now evaporated.

Turkey still punches above its economic weight thanks to a strategic location and large army, second to the U.S. in NATO. For this reason, Turkish moves on the Middle Eastern chessboard are worth watching, as are Erdoğan’s ever-more brazen assaults on democratic liberties. But aside from the rightful concern U.S. policymakers should express about Erdoğan’s political and human rights abuses, there is little in Turkey’s foreign posturing that should alarm us. Turkey’s neighbors, including Israel, Iran, and Russia, may feel differently about Turkish moves and push back now that Erdoğan’s government is weakening. If they do, that is Erdoğan’s problem, not ours.",Right

Having already given us “beautiful tariffs” and “perfect phone calls,” he now promises to build “one of the greatest trade routes in all of history”—stretching “from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States.” Standing beside India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House in February, Trump declared that America and India agreed to work together on this ambitious project, which would connect key allies through ports, railways, and—Trump being Trump—“many, many undersea cables.” Unlike his first term, when infrastructure projects were mostly aspirational, Trump now speaks with the confidence of a man who has already spent some money and is prepared to spend a lot more. But what exactly is he talking about?

The trade corridor in question is officially called the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), but it is better understood through a term that I helped introduce: the New Golden Road. Unlike China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which is billed as a revival of the old Silk Road, the New Golden Road is a revival of a much older network of trade and commerce. Long before modern geopolitics, this route linked India to the Mediterranean world, carrying goods, ideas, and cultural influence across an ancient superhighway of trade.

The Golden Road’s rebirth signals a shift in global economic alignment. But understanding the reasons behind this modern-day revival, along with the network’s historical roots, is crucial to appreciating why the Trump administration has embraced this initiative.

As recounted in William Dalrymple’s masterly tome by the same name—The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World—the Golden Road’s origins can be traced to the height of the Roman Empire, when maritime trade routes connected the Mediterranean world with the Indian subcontinent. The Romans had an insatiable appetite for luxury goods from India and beyond—spices, silks, ivory, gemstones, and more. India, in turn, absorbed vast amounts of Roman gold. So extensive was this exchange that Pliny the Elder famously lamented how India was “the sink of the world’s most precious metals… draining the Roman Empire of at least 55 million sesterces annually.”​ Indian ports like Muziris on the Malabar Coast flourished, receiving Roman gold coins in exchange for highly coveted goods. In fact, to this day, the Indian subcontinent holds the largest collection of ancient Roman gold coins found outside the empire.

It was Roman control over Egypt after the Battle of Actium in 31 BC that catalyzed this trade, allowing merchants to travel through the Red Sea. Numbers tell the difference: An overland caravan roundtrip from the Mediterranean to India and back again could take at least three years. With the monsoon winds, though, a ship could sail from the Red Sea to Gujarat in just forty days—provided one departed in early summer and caught the return winds by August. If that window was missed, the round trip could take nearly a year.

The Greek geographer Strabo noted a sixfold increase in ships sailing annually from the Red Sea to India compared to the Ptolemaic era: “Formerly not even [twenty] vessels ventured to navigate the Arabian Gulf, but now large fleets are despatched.” The importance of this trade to the Roman Empire’s economy​ cannot be overstated; at its peak, the Roman treasury derived up to a third of its revenues from the customs duties levied on Indo-Roman trade through the Red Sea. This was the first proto-global economy, with monsoon winds dictating shipping schedules, drawing India closer to the Mediterranean in both commerce and culture.

This splendid system of exchange survived the fall of Roman power in the fifth century and endured well into the Arab expansion of the seventh century, transforming the Golden Road into a network dominated by Islamic maritime commerce. This introduced a new layer of economic and cultural integration across the region, with monsoon-versed Arab traders acting as intermediaries. In the process, they transmitted Indian scientific knowledge, astronomical advancements, and mathematics to the Mediterranean world. In fact, what we today call “Arabic numerals”—the decimal digits of zero through nine used in the modern world—are, in fact, Indian in origin. As Dalrymple recounts:

Mathematicians initially overcame the problem of denoting empty spaces in decimal place-value notation by drawing a space-holder dot where there was a missing entry. This was probably first tried out around 3000 BCE in the temples of Sumer, not far from what would become Baghdad. The innovation was passed on to both the Babylonians and the Persians, but it was in India that the use of a circle gave rise to the present-day symbol 0 for zero. It was also the Indians who named that symbol sunya, meaning emptiness or the void, linking it to a fundamental concept in Indian Buddhist philosophy. From this word came the Arabic zifr and hence the English “cipher.”

By the Middle Ages, Europe’s demand for Eastern goods hadn’t diminished, but access to the Golden Road became increasingly difficult due to constant clashes between Cross and Crescent. The Venetians, those adept maritime traders, became the dominant European players in the Indo-Mediterranean economy by securing a monopoly over the spice trade through agreements with the Mamluks of Egypt. They profited immensely by acting as middlemen between Indian spice exporters and European markets.

But it was the Portuguese, led by Vasco da Gama, who shattered this lucrative monopoly in 1498 by discovering a direct sea route to India around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. The Portuguese presence in Goa and other Indian coastal cities marked the beginning of European colonial expansion and eventual domination of the Indian Ocean. This is perhaps human history’s irony: The innovations from the East—mathematics from India, gunpowder from China, and so forth—were refined by Europeans and then used by the West to expand into and dominate the East.

None exemplified this dynamic more than the British Empire. Where earlier empires had participated in Indian Ocean commerce as trading partners, it was the British who turned India into the beating heart of a global imperial system. Through the East India Company, Britain slowly dismantled the old trading networks that had sustained Indo-Mediterranean commerce for centuries. What was once an open system of mutual exchange was refashioned into a tightly controlled mechanism for extracting wealth and maintaining supremacy.

By the 19th century, the British grip over India was matched by its increasing dominance over global maritime logistics. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was a watershed. The canal did not just shorten the sea route from Europe to India—it reoriented the geography of global power. What once took weeks around the Cape of Good Hope now took days. London was brought into almost telegraphic proximity to Bombay. As the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli quipped in 1847, “The East is a career.”

At this point, it should be noted that, while the Suez Canal is primarily remembered as a Franco-Egyptian engineering feat, it had a critical and often overlooked Central European dimension. The port city of Trieste, then the primary port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was a crucial Mediterranean node for eastward trade. Trieste’s role was championed by Pasquale Revoltella, a Venetian-born Triestine businessman and vice president of the Suez Canal Company, who was instrumental in financing and promoting the canal’s construction. Revoltella understood what many in Vienna and Paris only dimly grasped: that the canal would reorder global trade, restoring a direct east-west axis across the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. He envisioned Trieste as the northern anchor of this revived maritime route—a Mediterranean gateway not just for Austrian commerce, but for Europe’s future in Asia.

Yet while the Suez Canal enabled the British Empire to consolidate control over its Indian possessions, it also created vulnerabilities. By the 20th century, Britain’s dependence on the Suez route for imperial logistics was a strategic liability—one laid bare in 1956 during the Suez Crisis.

When Egypt’s President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, Britain, France, and Israel launched a military intervention to seize it back. The operation was militarily successful but geopolitically disastrous. Facing economic pressure and diplomatic opposition from both the United States and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Anthony Eden was forced into an abrupt withdrawal. The message was clear: Britain could no longer act unilaterally, and its imperial days were over. The canal, once a symbol of imperial mastery over the Golden Road, became the site of imperial unraveling. Trieste, too, faded into strategic obscurity—its dreams of serving as a gateway between Europe and Asia were buried as its economic hinterland was locked behind the Iron Curtain.

In this sense, the 1956 crisis was more than a diplomatic debacle; it was the final punctuation mark on the old Golden Road. The corridor that once conveyed Roman gold to Indian ports met an inglorious end.

Or has it?

India, in a broad historical sense, is back. Its ascent on the global economic stage is noteworthy. In just over three decades since its economic liberalization in 1991, India’s GDP had expanded from roughly $270 billion to more than $3.7 trillion by 2022, propelling it to the rank of the fifth-largest economy worldwide. Through fits and starts, and much painful development, the country has evolved from a closed, state-led economy into one of the world’s more dynamic growth engines. With favorable demographics, a booming services sector, and a steadily maturing manufacturing base, India is now projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030, with GDP expected to reach $7.3 trillion.

As India reasserts itself as a civilizational and commercial force, it is once again becoming the anchor of an Indo-Mediterranean trade revival. This took formal shape in 2023 with the unveiling of the IMEC during the G20 Summit. This modern corridor, backed by eight founding signatories (India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Italy, France, Germany, the European Union, and the United States), is de facto a revival of the Golden Road. It is, in effect, the New Golden Road. And far from being just a trade network, it is also the blueprint for a new geoeconomic alignment.

Everyone has a stake in this strategic opportunity, albeit for different reasons.

For India, the New Golden Road offers both a gateway to deeper integration into global value chains and a geopolitical lever to balance China’s growing assertiveness. Modi has cast the initiative in grand historical terms, declaring it “the basis of world trade for hundreds of years to come,” and reminding audiences that it began “on Indian soil.”

For the Gulf states, the corridor served as a hedge—allowing them to maintain equilibrium between Washington and Beijing while reinforcing their role as indispensable players in a multipolar world. It also aligns with their broader push to diversify energy exports and invest in East–West infrastructure.

For Europe, the initiative promises a boost to economic security, rewiring supply chains away from China and toward India, opening new markets, and providing a long-sought improved energy bridge to the Gulf.

For Israel, the New Golden Road is the culmination of what began with the signing of the Abraham Accords. It is the country’s one chance to anchor its long-term security in economic integration rather than military dominance. By becoming a key junction in the corridor, Israel gains both strategic relevance and commercial dividends—particularly through its port infrastructure and its connection to the Gulf via land and digital links. As I’ve noted elsewhere, this shift toward regional economic integration offers Israel a pathway to greater stability by aligning its future with broader prosperity in the Middle East, rather than permanent confrontation. In this sense, for Israel, the New Golden Road is not merely a trade route—it is the scaffolding for a different kind of regional order, one in which it is embedded, connected, and indispensable.

But it is the United States that has, perhaps, the most reason to hope the New Golden Road succeeds. This is because Washington views the initiative through its broader policies of downscaling its global involvement, what I term the American Sphere Doctrine, and simultaneously restraining China’s geopolitical influence across Eurasia by knitting together key regions along the periphery. The New Golden Road achieves this in three ways.

First, at its core, the corridor serves to reorient global supply chains away from China and toward India, which Washington increasingly sees as its most important long-term economic and strategic partner in Asia. India’s rise as a manufacturing power and its shared democratic institutions make it a natural counterweight to China, particularly as Washington seeks to “de-risk” economic dependencies created over decades of globalization. The New Golden Road reinforces this shift by establishing new routes and infrastructure that bypass China entirely, connecting Indian production hubs to markets in Europe and the United States via the Gulf and Mediterranean. This aligns with the economic dimension of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, exemplified by initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

Second, the New Golden Road offers the U.S. a pathway to reduce its direct involvement in the Middle East by encouraging the emergence of a new regional order built around economic interdependence rather than American military primacy. For decades, U.S. engagement in the region has been marked by security guarantees, costly interventions, and volatile alliances. With this new structure, however, the focus shifts toward economic alignment, infrastructure development, energy cooperation, and digital connectivity—pillars of stability that empower and incentivize regional actors to take greater responsibility for their own security and prosperity.

Third, this also advances the long-standing American goal of promoting burden-sharing among its allies. By integrating European and Middle Eastern partners into a shared economic corridor, the New Golden Road distributes the cost and responsibility of regional stability across a broader coalition. This is especially important for Washington, as it seeks to concentrate its strategic attention and finite resources on the Pacific theater, where tensions with China are most acute. In this sense, the New Golden Road is not only a counter-China initiative in economic terms—it is also a tool of strategic rebalancing. By helping to stabilize “West Asia,” as the Indo-Mediterranean region is also called, and connect it more closely to the Indo-Pacific, the United States positions itself to contain China across multiple fronts while reducing its own strategic overextension.

In short, when President Trump spoke about “one of the greatest trade routes in all of history,” he was talking about the New Golden Road—a term that he would do well to use. But this leaves one question unanswered. When Trump said that the route would run “from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States,” why did he include Italy, aside from creative alliteration?

Simply put, it is because of Trieste. The New Golden Road has revived the dream of the city serving as the primary maritime and logistical gateway between Europe and Asia. It is, after all, the most strategically located port on the Mediterranean for connecting the European industrial heartland and the rising economies of Central and Eastern Europe—from Bavaria to the Balkans—to the Indo-Mediterranean world. Trieste’s deepwater harbor, robust rail connections, and historic role as the Habsburg Empire’s main entrepôt make it the northern anchor of the corridor. It is, in brief, Europe’s answer to Dubai and Mumbai.

This, then, is where the Trump administration should focus its efforts. If it is serious about making the New Golden Road more than just a rhetorical flourish, it must begin by recognizing the strategic centrality of Trieste. Of all the ports vying for prominence along Europe’s southern flank—Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Marseilles—none can match Trieste’s geographic advantage, historical pedigree, or logistical connectivity to the European industrial heartland. It is no accident that President George Washington authorized the establishment of the second-ever U.S. consulate in Europe in Trieste back in 1797. The city’s longstanding ties to the United States, its free port status, and its renewed relevance in transatlantic and Indo-Pacific strategies all point to one conclusion: Trieste should be formally designated as the sea terminus of the New Golden Road. A large-scale international summit in Trieste—bringing together key stakeholders from Europe, the Middle East, India, and the United States—would be the ideal venue to make this declaration. (As it happens, I serve as secretary general of the board of advisors of an association created precisely for this purpose.)

Second, the administration should formally adopt and promote the term “New Golden Road” when possible in place of the bureaucratic and uninspiring acronym “IMEC.” Names matter in politics, and in geopolitics even more so. The New Golden Road evokes a civilizational memory, a shared history of commerce and connectivity between East and West. It is bold, evocative, and—if we’re being honest—far more Trumpian than anything cooked up in a G20 communiqué. After all, what better way to sell a grand infrastructure project than by branding it with his favorite metal—and a name that already sounds like it belongs on a luxury hotel or a championship trophy?

Third, the White House should appoint a Special Presidential Envoy for the New Golden Road. Much of the corridor’s potential depends on sustained high-level diplomacy, not just between governments, but also among investors and regional stakeholders. While U.S. embassies and career diplomats play a vital role, regional leaders often look for signals of senior-level commitment. A presidential envoy, backed by the weight of the Oval Office, would lend credibility and urgency to the initiative.

Finally, the administration should push for the creation of a permanent IMEC Secretariat. This body would serve as a coordination hub for the corridor, managing everything from customs harmonization to research and dispute resolution. It would focus on three critical areas: first, developing frameworks for cross-border trade processes, ensuring that goods and services move seamlessly across the corridor; second, producing research and analysis that tracks the corridor’s impact and quantifies its benefits; and third, serving as a neutral platform to resolve disputes or technical disagreements among participating states. Without this kind of institutional backbone, the corridor risks being little more than a collection of announcements and empty promises. With it, the New Golden Road could become the engine of a new economic geography—one that binds together the democratic peripheries of Eurasia, underwrites regional prosperity, and checks the ambitions of America’s chief rivals.

CBS News,"Melissa Quinn, Natalie Brand",Federal probationary workers left in limbo amid legal challenges to mass firings,Probationary workers fired as part of President Trump's downsizing talked about their jobs and their ongoing employment limbo as legal fights continue.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/probationary-workers-in-limbo-legal-battles-over-their-firings-continue/,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/05/9f3ecdc4-8830-49de-a877-86d2acd4affa/thumbnail/1200x630/e5223c5771ef337d13bdc20bd595d332/ap25058808670537.jpg?v=7613930c2bdb7d1bf55be910a9b022f2,2025-04-06T19:26:12Z,Washington — Probationary workers were among the first victims of President Trump's second-term efforts to downsize the federal government. Mass firings across the federal government targeted thousan… [+11980 chars],"Washington — Probationary workers were among the first victims of President Trump's second-term efforts to downsize the federal government. Mass firings across the federal government targeted thousands of them, but legal challenges over their termination have left them in an uneasy employment limbo after a pair of court rulings that cover employees at 20 agencies.

These are workers who are in their first year or two of federal service, depending on their position, although probationary workers can also include experienced U.S. government employees who recently started working in a new position, including through promotions, or at a different agency.

Sara Nelson, 50, was just two days away from the end of her probationary period, which started after she was hired in February 2024 at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. She previously worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a different component of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Nelson, who lives in Georgia, managed multi-million-dollar nationwide campaigns to raise awareness of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Nelson said she loved the work she was doing and found it meaningful because it helped to connect Americans struggling with their mental health with a vital resource.

""Federal workers, the vast majority of us, are so dedicated to serving Americans, to serving our country,"" she said. ""We care about efficiencies in government. We're often caught up in these bureaucratic traps as well, but we're trying hard every day to bring 200%. The work of the government serves the American people.""

Nelson had received a positive performance review in January, she said, but the letter she got from the acting chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services stated that her ""performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.""

""It was totally unsettling,"" she said of receiving the termination letter. ""It's hard to describe because you know your team loves you and wants to keep you. You know there is a huge need, and yet you're being dismissed.""

Then, on March 18, Nelson received a brief, two-paragraph email from her agency informing her that she had been reinstated to her role. The notification came on the heels of two different court orders that required the administration to bring back probationary employees it had fired at more than a dozen agencies. The Justice Department has now asked the Supreme Court to lift one of those orders, covering more than 16,000 probationary workers at six agencies.

""HHS has canceled your separation from duty and you have been restored to duty in a paid Administrative Leave status through at least the end of this week. We will update you further once we have more information,"" the message Nelson received to her personal email address read.

While the note included two email addresses to direct questions, Nelson said messages she sent about back pay have gone unanswered. She also has not received any further information about her position at SAMHSA since learning of her reinstatement, Nelson said.

SAMHSA was impacted by layoffs of up to 10,000 people at the Health and Human Services Department. Another 10,000 at the department took early retirement or voluntary separation officers.

While Mr. Trump and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is leading the effort to shrink the size of the federal government, often speak of the need to root out waste at federal agencies, Nelson said there was never any assessment done within SAMHSA to pinpoint areas to improve efficiency.

""I can't describe the level of stress and confusion about what's happening,"" she said. ""We get the rug pulled out from under us multiple times. We're trying to find other jobs. But it's like, should I interview or might I get my old job back that I absolutely loved? But all we know at this point is we have to move forward.""

Court records have revealed that more than 24,500 federal workers who were in their probationary periods were fired in mid-February and have since been reinstated to comply with the judicial orders. Most of those employees have been put on administrative leave, agencies said, and whether they will be allowed to keep those jobs — and for how long — remains uncertain.

""They're trying to extend the authority of the executive, and the authority of [the Office of Personnel Management] in a manner that is completely inconsistent with the law and with the way the civil service system is set up to work,"" Michelle Bercovici, a lawyer at Alden Law Group who represents federal employees, said.

Bercovici said federal employees can be fired and held accountable for performance, but ""you just have to follow the rules.""

Legal proceedings in the two cases involving the mass firings of government workers are ongoing, and on Tuesday, one of the judges issued a preliminary injunction that blocked terminations of probationary workers in 19 states and the District of Columbika, which sued over the removals.

The injunction from U.S. District Judge James Bredar effectively extends an earlier decision ordering reinstatements at 20 agencies, but only for workers in the states that sued.

Separate from the courts, some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal employee terminations.

Isabel Dziak, 30, is among U.S. Forest Service workers in Juneau, Alaska, who were laid off in February. She served as a lead ranger at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, a role that not only educates tourists but handles any medical emergencies and park safety. The park serves 25,000 visitors a day in peak season, according to Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, with the first cruise ships of the year set to arrive next week.

Dziak said her team was gutted during government-wide probationary layoffs, and she was among the casualties because she was still in a probationary period, thanks to a promotion in 2023. She lost what she described as her dream job.

""I really showed up to my job every day, loving it and wanting to do the best and worked really hard to make a career for myself,"" Dziak said. ""Having it stolen in such an illegal way is just unfathomable.""

In late February, then-special counsel Hampton Dellinger filed a request with the Merit Systems Protection Board for a 45-day pause on the firings of roughly 6,000 probationary workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the Forest Service.

The board granted the stay early last month and ordered USDA employees to be reinstated to their positions.

Dellinger had made his request to the MSPB while he pursued litigation challenging his own firing by Mr. Trump. A federal appeals court allowed his removal on March 5, the day the board granted his request to pause the USDA workers' firings. Dellinger has since dropped his case.

In an earlier statement, he said the Office of Special Counsel ""requested this stay because the thousands of probationary terminations at USDA appear to have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with federal personnel laws.""

It's unclear who is serving as the acting special counsel. A request for comment from the Office of Special Counsel was not returned, and that information is not available on the agency's website. The acting special counsel would ask the MSPB to extend the pause on the firings of USDA workers that is set to expire on April 18.

Mr. Trump also fired a member of the MSPB, leaving it with one member, acting chairman Henry Kerner. Because Kerner is the sole member of the board, it lacks a quorum and cannot issue final decisions on petitions for review until it is restored.

""The fundamentals of the civil service system are directly under fire,"" Bercovici said. ""The processes are still moving along as they should, but the administration is targeting the tips of the spear, the critical chokepoints where decisions actually happen.""

The administration believes it will prevail as the cases work their way up to the Supreme Court, arguing the firings were within the administration's authority to manage its internal affairs.

A senior administration official blamed the lower courts and ""activist judges"" for keeping probationary employees in limbo and claimed many employees have moved on. The administration hopes they seek employment in the private sector, the official said.

At the USDA, workers including Dziak have also received what was billed as a ""second and final"" deferred resignation offer, running through April 8.

A spokesman said the Agriculture Department is giving employees an opportunity ""to take control of their next step in federal service before any changes take place."" Roughly 75,000 federal workers accepted an earlier offer from the Trump administration to leave their government positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.

After weighing whether to take the new offer and wondering if she was even eligible, Dziak decided to accept it, though it's pending approval from the agency. In the meantime, she says she's received two paychecks, as part of the backpay ordered by the MSPB.

She said she was also asked about her interest in returning to work but is worried she could be fired in a future reduction-in-force.

A major factor for Dziak is having health insurance coverage and whether she would be able to keep her plan until September through the deferred resignation program, she said. If not, Dziak said she may have to go back on Medicaid.

""That's kind of the sticky situation that I find myself in, plus the moral of do I want to take this essentially buyout,"" she said. ""Morally, I don't want to be bought out from my job that I've been battling to keep and ultimately decided to walk away from because the work environment is just terrible.""

Dziak called the confusion surrounding what happens next for federal workers like her ""disheartening.""

Alex, a National Park Service employee who works at a site in New York City, started his job in May 2024 and was working on programs for America's 250th Birthday celebration next year.

Alex, who asked to be identified by his first name because he is still waiting to receive full back pay, said he was looking forward to educating park site visitors on the nation's history. Expecting to receive a termination email on Valentine's Day, when thousands of other probationary workers did, Alex said he left for the day after receiving no word from his agency.

But when he returned on Monday, Alex said he had an after-hours email from Feb. 14 saying he had been fired for performance reasons, even though his most recent performance review rated him as ""fully successful.""

""My biggest concern was with my career,"" he said. ""The main reason I took this job was to advance my career in the federal government.""

Alex said he had been working toward a specific hiring designation for certain employees of a land management agency, which allows them to compete for permanent positions in the competitive service, and qualified for it after he was fired and then reinstated.

Like the other federal workers who were abruptly fired and then rehired, Alex said he received an email informing him that his termination had been canceled and cited his work on America's 250th Birthday as the reason. But he hasn't received any further guidance about benefits, and when he returned to his office, he didn't have a computer or an access card for more than a week.

Alex said he still has several months on his lease in New York City but is applying now for other jobs, including as a state park ranger and at other federal agencies.

""Everyone is scared, and it puts a damper on working here,"" he said. ""It had been exciting, being in the big city working on these programs for the public, for the anniversary. Now, I just want to leave.""",Lean Left

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.

And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump vows to reshape global trade, and that sends stock markets reeling. Is it just short-term pain or a long-term problem?

President Trump delivered on his campaign promises, putting 25 percent duties on foreign autos and 10 percent on imports from all countries, but his decision to launch a surprise round of wide-ranging tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, shocked investors and sparked recession fears.

(Begin VT)

DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: The president claims all is going according to plan and hit the links this weekend, though he was tracking headlines about China's decision to fire back with tariffs on all American products.

We will get the latest from President Trump's point man on tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and check in with the number two Senate Republican, John Barrasso. He's tasked with carrying out the other part of the president's economic agenda, sweeping tax cuts.

House Republican Don Bacon and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell will also join us. They want Congress to reclaim its authority over trade policy.

Then, as the administration continues talks with Russia for a possible peace deal in Ukraine, we will ask NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte what the budding relationship could mean for the future of the Western alliance.

It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.

Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.

It is shaping up to be another turbulent week, as President Trump's trade war with the world escalates. The global sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements wiped out more than $6 trillion of wealth from the U.S. stock market in just two days.

In a social media post yesterday, the president urged the country to hang tough, all this as tens of thousands of people took to the streets yesterday from Washington, D.C., to Minnesota and Columbus, Ohio, protesting many of Trump's policies, Elon Musk and tariffs.

We begin this morning with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Mr. Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation.

HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60 percent of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning.

Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, you have got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right?

All our semiconductors are made overseas, so every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We have got to start to protect ourselves, and we have got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it.

So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. And…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's just not going to take it anymore, and that's his model.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting it at the center of his economic policy.

But you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that, or were you surprised?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike.

The idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us, remember, $1.2 trillion – in 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's a different world. This is a different market.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And now – and now they own $18 trillion of us net. So that means the rest of the world – every year, when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America.

And it goes up and up and up, and eventually we're not going to own America, and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Imagine if we had a war and we can't build a ship…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: … we can't fly a plane, we can't build our own planes, we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the president is here to fix for America. It's in his hands and he wants to fix America. This is his chance to fix America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but for businesses to do what you're doing, because what I hear you laying out there is a plan to reindustrialize the United States and to bring companies back to America.

For a CEO to choose to invest…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But for a CEO to make those decisions, you know this, they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas or if it costs them more to move here.

So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariffs? Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Absolutely.

The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars, you heard the president speak about it, are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world.

We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here and we will protect them for building it here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So does…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We will help the American workers. Yes, American workers are more expensive, but they're better.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America. And that's what's coming here. So, the president is on it. He's going to protect them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, remember, this is a national security issue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he needs to address our budget deficit.

That – you know, the laws of America are the laws of America. He would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here.

The ripoff of the United States of America is over.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they have committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy. This is the place to go.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Mr. Secretary, though – Mr. Secretary, the campaign is over. You won.

So I'm asking what the plan is. So, the Treasury secretary said on another network: ""We're going to hold the course. It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.""

That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the president considering postponing implementation to negotiate?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious.

The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. The countries of the world are ripping us off.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And it's got to end. The president has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy.

We are going to protect – the factories that come build in America, we are going to protect them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the Earth.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All of these companies are going to come and build here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the president's other economic advisers who are on other networks today say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean?

Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they have been ripping us off and the day has come for that to end.

Now, the problem is, it's not just tariffs. Like, I will give you an example. Like, Vietnam said, they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we send them about $12 billion. Wait. We send them $12 billion.

So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to $200 billion with us. We need to stop the ripoff. And zero-zero is the way to make them more of a ripoff.

MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but we don't have zero-zero, sir.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need…

MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero, actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that wasn't actually tariffs.

That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula. And the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face 10 percent tariffs?

Did you use A.I. to generate this?

(LAUGHTER)

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No. No, the idea – look, the idea is that there are many countries left off.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Because the idea – what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.

Any country – like, we had tariffs – the president put tariffs on China, right, in 2018. And then what China started doing is, they started going through other countries to America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They just built through other countries through America.

And so the president knows that. He's tired of it. And he's going to fix that. So, basically, he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Through the…

(CROSSTALK)

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: So he ended those loopholes, these ridiculous loopholes.

And now what he's trying to say is, I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States of America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's a national security issue. We need to make medicine. We need to make semiconductors.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need to make ships. We need to have steel and aluminum. Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's tired of getting ripped off by the rest of the world.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but, just to be clear, April 9, the so-called retaliatory tariffs, the reciprocal tariffs, I should say, are those coming or are they open to negotiation?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: He announced it and he wasn't kidding.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

Is the administration considering any kind of offset, any kind of subsidy? You mentioned, the first administration, there was some bailout to farmers to help them deal with the pain from Chinese retaliation.

Are you looking at that now?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I'm – not that I have – I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on – you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes years.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And that is going to matter to us.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So, those aren't union worker jobs.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories, automated factories. But the key is, who's going to build the factories, who's going to operate the factories, who's going to make them work, great American workers.

You know, we are going to replace…

MARGARET BRENNAN: You said robots on other networks. You said that to FOX.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: … the armies of millions of people – well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.

It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tradecraft of America, our high school- educated Americans, the core to our work force is going to have the greatest resurgence…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: … of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America. That's what's going to build our next generation of America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned that – are you concerned, in the time it will take for a company to move to America, that it will benefit China in the – in the immediate term, that other markets will look to other suppliers, instead of dealing with the United States?

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That is ridiculous. The problem is, everyone in the world sells to us.

Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are they selling $200 billion a year…

(CROSSTALK)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary…

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: … more to us?

It's because it's not fair. The rules are made not fair. And President Trump is going to fix them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's doing it for America, and he's doing it for your children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump's been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump's agenda.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we're all here to help him execute it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will take him at his word, quite literally.

Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your time this morning.

Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by one of the top Republicans in the Senate, Wyoming's John Barrasso, the whip.

Good to have you here in person, Senator.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-Wyoming): Thanks. Great to be with you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about what the secretary just laid out. He did not describe this as leverage to get to a deal, said this – take him literally – the tariffs are here to stay.

We have already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit, saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well I think he is.

But, look, this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are – and I'm talking about a change in terms of the size, as well as the priorities. And this is a 180-degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes.

And we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more – better jobs, more opportunities, and more money in their own pockets.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool.

And I think we have to go after China. They have been abusing us for years. And I believe the president is on const – firm constitutional grounds.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I hear you talk about sort of the one-two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them, isn't there some coordination on sequencing here?

Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the campaign.

MARGARET BRENNAN: He was indeed.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: There is no surprise here. He's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have.

We have a lot of work to do to reverse the damage that's been done over the last four years with the Democrats that led to the highest inflation in 40 years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So the president wants to get a lot of things done. And I want to get a lot of things done in Congress as part of this comprehensive economic plan.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw the Fed chair also say that we may be facing inflation now in part because of these tariffs.

You know some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program, partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours' notice on tariffs, suggest they didn't get much this time.

And they want them to expire after 60 days unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

But let me just say, the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the presidents, different presidents, more and more authority to deal with national security issues with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority.

I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then. Many of the cosponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we will see where it goes from there.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years…

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: … more and more authority has been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade.

And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there will be a discussion in the Senate. We will see which way the discussion goes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take the step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework.

You know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over in the House. Jodey Arrington, the Budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing, accused your Republican colleagues of creating $6 trillion in new costs and a mere $4 billion in enforceable cuts.

Is this headed for failure in the House?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No.

We are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step.

So what we have seen…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Five Republicans have come out against it. And it's a pretty narrow margin.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: But they all agree with what we want to do, which is unleash American energy to get energy prices down for people. They all agree that we ought to make sure that we don't have these $4 trillion tax increases.

They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now, I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the House. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like, if you have to take another bite at the apple – the reason that this matters so much is procedurally you have got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get done, like the tax cuts, by September.

Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I'm not worried about deadlines. I want to get – I have an urgency to get it done as soon as we can, so we can get these policies in place and also to provide the certainty to people who are worried, are my taxes going to go up at the end of the year?

They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the folks around the country, that they will see that we have – on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And we want to get the country back on track. And the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage that the Democrats have done over the last four years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You have got to get Speaker Johnson to wrangle those votes, though…

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: … which you admit they're not there right now?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, we're going to put the language together. We do have to iron out the differences.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And I'm committed to getting it done.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in about 18 months, Congress will face elections, these midterm races.

Here's your fellow Republican Senator Rand Paul.

(Begin VT)

SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Historically, tariffs have also led to political decimation. When McKinley most famously put tariffs on in 1890, they lost 50 percent of their seats in the next election.

When Hawt-Smooley (sic) put on their tariff in the early 1930s, we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you afraid history is going to repeat itself in 2026?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, no, I'm not. There's a long way between now and the 2026 elections.

President Trump won based on two things, that the Democrats were the party of high prices and an open border. No one doubted President Trump's ability to get the border closed, and 137,000 illegal immigrants…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: … in March of last year of Biden, this past March, down to 7,000. So he has been able to do that.

The Republicans are going to be judged on the economy, which is why I'm not concerned about – and…

MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Fed chairman is saying inflation is going to potentially go up and there's great uncertainty.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: That's why I want to get this comprehensive economic plan in place as soon as possible, the certainty that the tax increases are not going to be there, the certainty that we have American energy and those jobs, the certainty we're bringing jobs back into the country.

All of those things are going to make sure that, by the election 18 months from now, that people say, yes, we're on the right path.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Republicans have gotten the country back. The country is back on track.

I mean, right now, from I think it's even your own CBS poll, in terms of right track/wrong track, right direction/wrong direction, we're at the highest we have been in 20 years in terms of the direction the country is heading.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that was pre-tariffs.

Senator Ted Cruz said this:

(Begin VT)

SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short-lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of concern, including from your – your old friend Mitch McConnell. When do you get concerned that this is going to hurt the economic story you are trying to tell?

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, you won't be surprised. Ted and I were on the floor just yesterday, 2:00 in the morning.

I said, you know, ""I bet Margaret's going to show that tape of what you just said about tariffs."" And we joked about it a little bit.

But there is concern. I mean, there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets. This is not a surprise. People are concerned about this – 40(k) – 401(k)s, retirement plans, they do the best when we have confidence in the future, when we have a strong, healthy, growing economy.

And that's why we have a comprehensive economic plan to deal with all of this, to making sure the taxes don't go up, to cut so much of this reckless Washington spending. People saw the list of all the terrible things we've been spending money on in the last four years, and people were offended and angry at that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We're – what we're doing is also cutting a lot of this reckless Washington spending, gives people more money in their own pockets.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know markets move a lot faster than Congress does, Senator.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: They do.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got your work cut out for you.

But we appreciate you laying out the details for us.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.

Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an interview or an episode of Face the Nation, you can watch it on our YouTube page or on FacetheNation.com.

We will be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell and Republican Congressman Don Bacon. They have some ideas about how Congress can rein in the president's power to issue tariffs.

And we will discuss that on the other side of this break. So, stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.

We turn now to the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Washington state senator, Maria Cantwell.

Good to have you here.

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL (D-WA): Thank you so much for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, you heard the - the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, the first day of interdiction we signed up seven Republicans. So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board. But I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface. And certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people.

So, I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today consumer groups are announcing and retailers the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so, I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got, what six Republicans at this point?

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Seven.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven. And now you're saying retailers. Like, you have CEOs who are onboard or industry groups?

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Industry groups, like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the Consumer Electronics Group, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy. And so, they are very anxious about a plan.

Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life. And the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters in Greek - all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people are - consumers are saying. How is this helping me, in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods.

And so, I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both of - have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So, how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the Commerce secretary say that basically these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I -

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how long before damage?

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're - we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples, and markets closed. And what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland. Some big corporation might buy it. But you lose family farms. So, our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets.

The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agriculture products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact, when his last tariffs on India -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: We reopened with the apple market and we went to India and said, let's - let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have - we want to see today.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So, I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing - you could get the letter from the Machinist International. They don't support the president on this. And that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes. And lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive.

So, they don't like the uncertainty. And what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So, when you think of chips and science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment in innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Boeing's CEO testified, 80 percent of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S., 80 percent of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?

SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them. That, you know, that if they're not front and center in this - in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is - there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit.

So, they are trying so say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive. Don't make the parts more expensive. Make it cheaper. And the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products.

So, I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

CANTWELL: And that's why those groups are joining us today.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.

CANTWELL: Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha.

Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here. But just to - to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about. I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They've tucked language into the continuing resolution.

Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-NE): Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.

And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I - I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate. And I have some beginning support in the House side which will unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House no doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate it will put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.

So, it will not pass tomorrow -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Or maybe in the next couple weeks. But this will be in the queue that we can use. And it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, there's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republicans supported tariffs in the 1800s. And up and through, what, 1930, when we passed the Smoot-Hartley Act that created one of the worst - well, the worst depressions we ever had, we learned from that, that tariffs and protectionism does not work and that free trade, in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness. Some of these countries do treat us wrong. But fair trade should be the goal.

And you're right, the president talked about those. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've - I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border. And he has really delivered there. They voted for him, too, because inflation surpassed wage increases. They've - they were poorer today than they were four years ago. And I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime if they - crime in the big cities.

I don't think, in the end, I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision-making when it came to last November.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, I just - I know we certainly covered them on this program. And it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid.

But there is a conservative group, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think ultimately it's in Congress once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well.

The Constitution makes it very clear, Congress has control of taxes. And by the way - and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution. And we gave the president emergency powers. So, the courts will have to decide is what - what just happened, is this emergency powers or is this a total change in tariff policy. And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts and they work with the military, with Cyber Command.

Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four-star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the U.S. military to lead Cyber Command and National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: So, you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. And I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified. Guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And it's - it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation. And it hurt us.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and our reporting, as a network, is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things.

It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer.

I'm wondering, again respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control and you have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I'm sure there will be some oversight. I'm a - I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the secretary of defense speak to us, and he will be asked about this. And I will -

MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he even know?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I don't know that he knew, but we'll find out when we ask him. We'll ask him. He'll say that this is the president's right. And the president does have constitutional right to do this. But it doesn't make it appropriate or - OK, he may have the constitutional authority to do it, but it doesn't make it right.

And, in the end, I'm going to make it clear, we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA. And we will ask about it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Now, we have oversight. That doesn't mean we can - the president does have the constitutional authority to do this. But we have a - we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you -

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And I have a responsibility to make clear this was wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: You know, it's possible. I know that's out there. But I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You can't do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SECNET (ph).

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: If you separate them and put them under two different commands, then you're going to create a dysfunctional partnership and it will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.

OK. Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time.

REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.

We'll be back in a moment.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday we spoke with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and began our conversation by asking about the potential impact of the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs on the security alliance.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK RUTTE, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: There are tensions between the allies because of these - this tariffs question. But this is not concerning the alliance as a whole because there will be potentially impact on - on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The next summit is now going to be held in June. And leaders there expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2 percent to 3 percent. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5 percent on a country's own defense.

How do you convince members to spend more, to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?

MARK RUTTE: What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine because we've got to stop the killing. We have got to stop the fighting. And I commend him for that.

And then when it comes to defense spending, last couple of months, here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering, the amount of billions coming in. We have to continue doing this because, as I said in December, if he would stick to the old 2 percent, we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?

MARK RUTTE: Of course, I am - I am not in the room when all these talks take place. But what I am seeing from a - from distance and hearing from my American colleagues and all - including the president, whom I visited a couple weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and - and - and during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. The goal clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors. That - that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end. The Ukrainians are - are really close to the American position. And - and - and we have seen - we have to see how far the Americans can get this.

But I am completely supporting that effort because this war of protection - - protection, it was unsustainable in the long term. So many people dying. So much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged. Cities being destroyed. It's got to end.

MARGARET BRENNAN: General Cavoli, who you know well as the supreme allied commander of NATO, the U.S. general, is here in Washington testifying this week. He said, ""Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence."" What is happening to NATO members here? And - and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?

MARK RUTTE: What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but - but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians, through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure between the Baltic countries and Finland, and in other parts of the Baltic - in the Baltic Sea. They are - they are conducting this campaign.

The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?

MARK RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

MARK RUTTE: And I have no day to day assessment. But the reports we are getting is that Russia is still very active. We are still worried about, for example, (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure. But things do (INAUDIBLE). And in his role as supreme allied commander, we have in - in less than ten days brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the - in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this.

And again they - they hate us for this. And - and I love that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be? And is there NATO backup plan?

MARK RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown, but we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration, but, by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010, to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

MARK RUTTE: And agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary, and in surprises way. I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific.

And by the way, also thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific, with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?

MARK RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability of the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more NATO ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem. The United States, part of NATO, Canadian part of NATO, European part of the NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial product. We are producing, in - in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months, that's totally crazy. And that's why the president and I discussed and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed also with European allies that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production, that includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just to quickly clarify that - China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?

MARK RUTTE: Well, it's there not to be used against China. But I would say, amore generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran, and that in the end it is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first secretary of the communist party of China, Xi Jinping, and he will access when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top. Is it the west or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. So, there are big risks involved. And that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting and that Putin will never try this again.

Legacy media and longtime politics reporters are increasingly reporting on scandals that rocked the Democratic Party ahead of the November election, shining additional light on political issues that Republicans had long spotlighted and railed against. 
""A full 4½ years after The Post’s bombshell series on Hunter Biden’s influence-peddling schemes, The New York Times has deigned to take an interest in the former First Son’s corruption,"" the New York Post's editorial board wrote in a piece last week slamming the New York Times for reporting on Biden corruption allegations years after other outlets had already uncovered reported details. 
""We’d say the Times’ willingness to at long last cover this comes better late than never, but it only published the story now that it doesn’t remotely matter anymore,"" the editorial board continued. 
The New York Times declared in an article published on Friday that former first son Hunter Biden ""sought support from the State Department"" to aid his former employer, Ukrainian energy company Burisma, while his father served as vice president. Hunter Biden allegedly leveraging his last name and father's political status in the U.S. has long been criticized by conservatives, who have alleged that Hunter and his father engaged in influence-peddling through Burisma.  
BIDEN'S CLAIM TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS IS BECOMING HARDER TO MAINTAIN

Hunter Biden was paid millions of dollars while serving on the board of Burisma after joining the company as legal counsel in the spring of 2014 before being elevated to the Board of Directors later that year. 
The Bidens were accused by Republicans of having ""coerced"" the Burisma CEO into paying them millions of dollars in exchange for their help in getting the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the company fired during the Obama administration. 
The 46th president denied any involvement in his son's business dealings. 
Biden issued his son a sweeping 10-year pardon before exiting the Oval Office in January that protects Hunter Biden from offenses he ""has committed or may have committed"" from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024. Alleged Biden family influence-peddling has echoed from the halls of Congress to social media channels on X, but legacy outlets and left-wing media outlets often didn't give a platform to the allegations.

Jonathan Turley, Fox News' contributor and Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University, published an op-ed for Fox News Digital on Sunday remarking on the NYT's piece that was published years after other outlets and experts investigated alleged Biden family influence-peddling.
""For years, some of us have written about the Biden family’s multimillion-dollar influence-peddling operation and the Justice Department’s refusal to charge Hunter Biden with being an unregistered foreign agent. Now, years later, The New York Times has found evidence suggesting that the former president's son was acting as a foreign agent as early as the Obama administration, when his father was vice president,"" Turley wrote.
Media veterans and legacy outlets have leaned into reporting on and investigating a handful of other scandals and political news that conservatives had long sounded the alarm on, including that the coronavirus likely originated out of a lab in China, as well as on President Biden's mental decline in the lead-up to the election last year. 
PUBLIC WAS MISLED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ABOUT COVID ORIGINS, NY TIMES COLUMNIST ARGUES
The New York Times ran a column last month claiming the scientific community ""badly misled"" the public in an effort to suppress the theory that COVID-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, even after the paper's own science writer called the theory ""racist.""

""We Were Badly Misled About the Event That Changed Our Lives,"" the March 16 piece published by NYT columnist and Princeton sociology professor Zeynep Tufekci, argued that the scientific community long suspected COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan lab, but purposefully ""hid or understated crucial facts,"" to mislead the public about the lab’s ""terrifyingly lax"" safety precautions. 
'MOST DAMNING EVIDENCE': HUNTER BIDEN'S FULL PARDON RESURFACES DECADE OF CONTROVERSIES, 'INFLUENCE-PEDDLING'
""We have since learned, however, that to promote the appearance of consensus, some officials and scientists hid or understated crucial facts, misled at least one reporter, orchestrated campaigns of supposedly independent voices and even compared notes about how to hide their communications in order to keep the public from hearing the whole story,"" Tufekci wrote.
The Trump administration's CIA reported earlier this year that the lab leak was the likely origin of the COVID-19 virus, which had previously been passed off by media outlets and scientists as a likely conspiracy theory. 
The New York Times defended that it had reported on the lab leak theory multiple times across the years, including in 2021, when approached for comment by Fox News Digital on the recent articles on both Hunter Biden and the lab leak theory. 
""The New York Times has intensely pursued every theory and lead on the origins of Covid-19, documented the political debate, funding, influence, and shifts in thinking among the scientific community, and reported on China’s censorship campaign that has stifled the search for truth. The Times has helped readers navigate the coronavirus pandemic through independent, verified reporting, and any insinuation that we have not thoroughly pursued leads is false,"" a NYT spokesperson said.

And a newly released book by longtime D.C. reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, ""Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,"" investigates Biden's mental decline in the lead-up to the general election, calling him a ""shell of himself.""
""All of them,"" Parnes told Vanity Fair of who in Biden's inner circle is most to blame for covering up his mental decline when he was in office. ""It’s pretty remarkable how they kept him very closed off. He was a shell of himself. When he entered the White House, he was so, so different from the man who I covered as vice president, a guy who would hold court in the Naval Observatory with reporters until the wee hours.""
""We’d been watching Biden’s decline for a long period of time and, honestly, thought he had lost his fastball some when he was running in 2020. And it was still so shocking to see the leader of the free world so bereft of coherent thought,"" Allen added of Biden's mental decline. 
Biden's debate performance was seen as an abject failure, with traditional allies soon joining conservatives in their concern over the president's health. (Getty Images)
Biden's mental acuity had been under conservatives' microscope since before the 2020 election, with concerns heightening in February 2024 when Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" 
JONATHAN TURLEY: BIDEN DOJ BEHIND EVEN THE TIMES IN PURSUING ALLEGED HUNTER CORRUPTION
The report renewed scrutiny over Biden’s mental fitness, which rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump. Biden's debate performance was seen as an abject failure, with traditional allies soon joining conservatives in their concern over the president's health in the context of encouraging Biden to pass the mantle to a younger generation of U.S. leaders.

Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor and longtime Trump critic, has also touted his upcoming book, ""Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,"" which is also anticipated to detail Biden’s mental decline and the alleged cover-up by members of the Democratic Party.

Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president’s newly announced tariffs, framing the move as a necessary economic reset and downplaying severe market volatility and uncertainty.

President Donald Trump has long cast himself as a dealmaker — and has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture about the possibility of relief.

Trump last week announced tariffs of at least 10% across all countries, with rates going even higher for 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders.” The universal 10% rate went into effect Saturday, while the customized rates will take effect Wednesday.

More than 50 countries have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs in the aftermath of Trump’s announcement, officials said Sunday.

That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they’ve been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”

﻿Though the president has previously paused tariffs to allow for negotiation in other situations, Lutnick made clear that the administration plans to follow through on the tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday.

“There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade,” he said, adding, “He announced it, and he wasn’t kidding, the tariffs are coming.”

Meanwhile, Trump said Sunday evening that he has been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders over the weekend on tariffs.

“I’ve spoken to many countries. … Every country is calling and being very solicitous, very, very nice,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.

Trump indicated Sunday he was open to negotiating — if countries address their trade deficits with the US.

“I do want to solve the deficit problem we have in China, with the European Union and other nations, and they’re going to have to do that. And if they want to talk about that, I’m open to talking,” the president said.

CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals, with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to meet with Trump at the White House on Monday for direct talks.

But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump’s senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn’t negotiating.

“This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that’s gotten out of control because of cheating. We’re always willing to listen, that’s what Donald Trump does best,” he said during an appearance on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”

Navarro added, “But I want to just say to the world here: If you want to come and talk to us, don’t say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. It’s the non-tariff cheating. Stop manipulating their currency, stop dumping stuff in.”

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was also unable to clearly state whether tariffs are here to stay or whether there was room for deals.

“This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we’re putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump has “created maximum leverage for himself.”

“It’s not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Elon Musk, one of Trump’s most influential advisors and the face of the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States, indicating room for negotiation.

“At the end of the day, I hope it’s agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said in a video-link interview with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, during a League congress in Florence.

On Sunday, the administration officials repeatedly downplayed the economic upheaval rocking markets. By the time the market closed Friday, the Dow had posted its biggest back-to-back losses since March 2020, during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening, and stocks were set to open sharply lower Monday.

Navarro urged American investors to “sit tight” and “not to panic.”

“The smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in. Because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we’ve ever seen under the Trump policies. … People should just sit tight — let that market find its bottom. Don’t get shook out by the panic in the media, and life is going to be beautiful under Donald John Trump,” he said.

With economists escalating concerns about the possibility of recession, Bessent said he rejected the assumption.

“There doesn’t have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity,” he said.

Goldman Sachs analysts in a note last week said economic growth driven by Trump’s fiscal policies would not be able to make up for the damage done by his massive tariff plan.

Rollins took issue with the characterization of the markets crashing and characterized it as an adjustment.

“As the economy, the market, begins to adjust, we will see a more positive — as we move, I believe, very quickly,” she told CNN.

Rollins also indicated there could be support for farmers impacted by the tariffs, pointing to previous relief during Trump’s first term.

“We have to be prepared that if there is longer-term damage … we will make sure that we have the funds in working with the senators and working with the appropriators, that we can do what we did last time,” she said.

For his part, the president returned to familiar patterns as anxious Americans watched their retirement accounts plummet, spending each of the past four days at one of his South Florida golf properties.

As protesters assembled to demonstrate against Trump’s tariff policies across the country — including in West Palm Beach — the White House offered an official statement announcing that the president won a golf tournament at his club Saturday.

“The President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow,” the statement said.

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the split-screen image “may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency”

“That is — the president out on a golf cart while people’s retirement is in flames,” he said.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska, Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha. Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here, but just to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about, I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They tucked language into the continuing resolution. Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?

REP. DON BACON: Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on. And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate, and I have some beginning support on the House side, which we'll unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House. No doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate, they'll put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction, or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill. So it will not pass tomorrow, or maybe in the next couple of weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use, and it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress, has the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch, and I think in hindsight, that was a mistake.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, that the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?

REP. BACON: There's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republican-supported tariffs in the 1800s and up and through 1930 when we passed the Smoot-Hartley act that created one of the worst- well, the worst depression we ever had. We learned from that that tariffs and protectionism does not work, and that free trade in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness, so these countries do treat us wrong, but fair trade should be the goal. And you're right. The president talked about this. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border, and he has really delivered there. They voted for him too because inflation surpassed wage increases. They were poorer today than they were four years ago. I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime, if they saw crime in the big cities. I don't think in the end- I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision making when it came to last November.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, I just- I know we certainly covered them on this program, and it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid. But there is a conservative group, the new Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?

REP. BACON: I think ultimately it's Congress, once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well. The Constitution makes it very clear Congress has control of taxes. And, by the way- and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution, and we gave the president emergency powers. So the courts will have to decide, is what- what just happened? Is this emergency powers, or is this a total change in tariff policy? And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts, and they work with the military, with Cyber Command. Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?

REP. BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the US military to lead Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations, so you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation. I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone. And it's- it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation, and it hurt us.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And our reporting as a network is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things. It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer. I'm wondering again, respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control. You have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?

REP. BACON: I'm sure there'll be some oversight. I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the Secretary of Defense speak to us, and He will be asked about this--

MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Did he even know?

REP. BACON: I don't know that he know, but we'll find out when we ask him, and we'll ask. They'll say that this is the president's right, and the president does have constitutional right to do this, but does it make it appropriate or okay? He may have the constitutional authority to do it, but does it make it right? And in the end, I'm going to make it clear we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA, and we will ask about it. Now, we have oversight, doesn't mean we can- the president does have the constitutional authority to do this, but we have- we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why. And I have a responsibility to make clear this is wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly. Do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?

REP. BACON: You know it's possible. I know that's out there, but I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You cannot do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SIGINT. If you separate, put them under two different commands, then you're gonna create a dysfunctional partnership and will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time. We have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",Lean Left

Lutnick says new tariffs are here to stay

Washington — Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that President Trump's reciprocal tariffs will take effect later this week, suggesting they aren't open to negotiation after the announcement sent shockwaves through the investment world and sparked recession fears.

""The tariffs are coming. He announced that, and he wasn't kidding,"" Lutnick said of Mr. Trump on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Last week, the president announced 10% tariffs on imports from all countries, along with increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports, which are set to go into effect this week. Meanwhile, financial markets saw their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while Mr. Trump urged Americans to ""hang tough.""

Lutnick defended the president's newly announced tariffs on Sunday, arguing that the policies will help protect American factories and ""reset the power of the United States of America.""

""This is a national security issue,"" Lutnick said, pointing to shortcomings in American manufacturing of things like medicines, ships and semiconductors, while adding that ""we've got to start to protect ourselves.""

The tariffs come after Mr. Trump previously delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico amid negotiations with the countries over immigration policies. But Lutnick said that ""there is no postponing"" the new round of tariffs, saying ""the president has made it crystal, crystal clear — this is the policy.""

Lutnick acknowledged that ""it is going to be a big change."" But he argued that ""the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years,"" saying the president is ""not going to take it anymore.""

""This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,"" Lutnick said. ""This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.""

Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who also appeared on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, said tariffs are about a ""monumental change in the direction of our government."" And he stressed that they're part of a larger picture that includes an effort by congressional Republicans to approve legislation unlocking key components of Mr. Trump's agenda, including extending his 2017 tax cuts.

""We have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people,"" Barrasso said, calling the tariffs a ""tool.""",Lean Left

While Starmer will still argue that tariffs are wrong, according to the Sunday Times report, the prime minister will also admit that he understands the rationale behind Trump’s move and why such policies have become increasingly popular with voters.
""Trump has done something that we don’t agree with, but there’s a reason why people are behind him on this,"" the prime minister’s office said in the statement.
Starmer is expected to emphasize the failures of free trade and mass migration specifically during the address on Sunday, the report said, arguing that it has failed millions of voters.

Two of the reasons Republicans were feeling their oats after the 2024 elections involved underlying trends. The first was that they performed better among marginal voters than the opposition, which meant that a boost in turnout would improve their percentage of the vote, reversing a longtime Democratic advantage. The second and even-better-known development was a significant boost in the Republican vote among Democratic “base” constituencies, particularly Latinos and Gen-Z voters.

These are both good long-term signs for the GOP. But in the very short term, as in the elections between now and 2028, they could portend underwhelming results for Republicans. For one thing, their new success among marginal voters in a high-turnout presidential election will not matter much in special, off-year, or midterm elections, when the voters Democrats now rely on are relatively sure to show up, particularly given the current panic over Trump 2.0’s radical early shape. And as Politico notes, right there in the 2024 returns are signs that the GOP’s overperformance among Democratic base voters probably won’t carry over to non-presidential elections. That’s because there was a lot of ticket-splitting last November, notably among Latinos:

Underlying the 2024 election results was a subtle trend that could signal a dramatic reshaping of the electorate: a surge in ticket-splitting among Latino voters who shifted sharply toward Donald Trump but also supported Democratic House and Senate candidates.

This helps explain why Democrats managed to win Senate races in four states Trump carried (Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin) and no less than 13 House races in districts carried by Trump. It seems entirely probable that downballot Democratic strength will carry over to the midterm congressional elections of 2026, as Politico suggests — unless, of course, 2024 reflected a more fundamental shift that will intensify even without Trump on the ballot:

Heavily Hispanic and Latino areas that saw significant ticket-splitting are key to many swing districts and battleground states. The party that can win over those voters — Republicans converting Trump supporters into reliable GOP voters, or Democrats bringing them back into the fold more firmly — will have a clear electoral advantage in the years ahead.

I wouldn’t count on long-term trends toward the GOP mattering much in the midterms, particularly given the other dynamic we are likely to see in 2026: an almost invariable loss of support by the party controlling the White House. One leading indicator: Of the 13 House districts that went for both Trump and a congressional Democrat in 2024, six have electorates that are at least 40 percent Latino. Democrats in those districts should do pretty well without a presidential candidate dragging them down.

Right now, I don’t think many Democrats are all that worried about how they’ll do in 2028 or 2032 or 2036. A comeback right away would be most welcome both in boosting Democratic morale and warning Republicans that all the over-the-top triumphalism we’re hearing from MAGA folk is built on a fragile foundation.",Left

At Columbia University, which has long borne witness to protests and dissent, the atmosphere has shifted under a new regime of policy changes ostensibly aimed at heightening security, according to CNN interviews with more than a dozen students and faculty.

Students who spoke with CNN – most of whom requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals – described a tense mood on campus as the changes take hold.

The atmosphere is far from what Maria, a master’s student at Columbia whose name has been changed to protect her identity, imagined when she enrolled last spring.

“I put my money down for Columbia thinking that I would be going to a prestigious university known as a protest university, home of some of the largest human rights student movements in the country. But then two days later, the (pro-Palestinian protest) encampment started and NYPD came onto campus,” she told CNN.

The Manhattan campus has become the reluctant poster child for President Donald Trump’s actions aimed at higher education. The administration has wielded its immigration authority to cancel the visas of hundreds of international students and visitors in the US and used the power of the purse to push for sweeping policy changes on campuses. Federal officials argue the moves are meant to combat antisemitism and bolster national security.

Universities – especially elite institutions – have for decades billed themselves as champions of free speech, and for many students and faculty, the stakes of the current controversy extend far beyond partisan politics – it’s about safeguarding the core values of free expression and the right to dissent. Many of those who spoke with CNN expressed optimism that a new wave of activism to protect those values may be building in response to the atmosphere of fear created by the president’s crackdown.

Maria told CNN that, to her, the administration’s actions convey a clear message: “Dissent is not a viable form of social participation in our country.”

Columbia is not alone in coming under pressure. In just the past week, the Trump administration suspended $210 million in research grants to Princeton University and announced reviews of $510 million in funding for Brown University and $9 billion for Harvard University. In recent months, the administration said it was investigating 10 schools for their handling of reports of antisemitism since 2023 and more than 50 for their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs.

“The Trump administration may have started by singling out Columbia, but we’re under no illusions that all universities – particularly elite universities – have targets on their backs,” said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton.

‘A fortress with high walls’: The chilling effect on campus activism

Maria told CNN she no longer protests on campus. She said she’s afraid of repercussions, which to her seem more likely under the new security policies Columbia announced last month, after federal agencies canceled $400 million in research grants and contracts to the university.

The changes effectively ban protests inside and immediately outside academic buildings. Anyone who does protest is banned from wearing a mask or any face covering meant to conceal their identity. The university also hired three dozen new campus police officers specifically trained to deal with protests, and they have arrest powers. Student groups that violate the policies will be sanctioned, Columbia said.

“I’m staunchly aware of how militarized and surveilled our campus is now,” Maria said.

Other students who spoke with CNN said security officers can be seen around campus every day, which they say fosters a fearful and uncertain atmosphere on campus.

“Are they here to protect me or am I the suspect?” said one student, who didn’t want to give their name out of fear of retaliation. “Columbia is now a fortress with high walls. Some people are scared to even attend class.”

CNN reached out to Columbia for response to the students’ sentiments.

Allie Wong, a PhD student at Columbia, also described the atmosphere on campus as one of pervasive fear – one that’s especially palpable for her because she says she’s witnessed firsthand some of the consequences of the administration’s crackdown.

Last month Wong briefly went to Canada with a fellow Columbia PhD student who chose to leave the US after ICE agents repeatedly showed up at her door. Shortly after, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted video of the pair at the airport, referring to the fellow student as “one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers.” (The student’s lawyer calls Noem’s statements “absolutely false.”)

“That was a very scary experience for me,” Wong told CNN of being cast in the spotlight. A longtime advocate for international students through the Student Workers of Columbia, Wong said she was doxxed for being part of last April’s protests, something she worries about happening again, along with other legal repercussions.

While fear hangs over the campus for some, others – notably Jewish students – have found relief. David Jonah Lederer, who took part in counter-protests following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, said the policy reforms were long overdue.

“The reforms pushed by the Trump administration at Columbia are not new,” Lederer told CNN. “We have been pushing for a mask ban, public safety reform, discipline, time, place and manner protest regulations, viewpoint diversity and broader governance reforms for over a year.”

Still, critics argue that the measures set a troubling precedent that could stifle all forms of expression, regardless of the cause.

“Many of the people who might lose scholarship and research funding have expressed no opinion on Israel-Palestine. Many are doubtless Jewish, too. This tells us that combating anti-Semitism is merely a pretext for stifling free expression,” Michael Cooperson, a professor of Arabic at UCLA, told CNN over email.

Asked last week about freedom of speech concerns surrounding the Trump administration’s cancellation of hundreds of student visas, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said international students are “here to go to class. They’re not here to lead activist movements.”

A new era of activism?

Princeton’s Scheppele, who said she’s witnessed autocratic initiatives firsthand during her research on Russia and Hungary, argues the administration fails to recognize the vital role campus debate plays in democratic society by producing citizens who can think for themselves.

Scheppele predicts “serious clashes ahead” as universities are “put into impossible situations” and student activists “refuse to cave in to the political pressures.”

Gil Eyal, a sociology professor at Columbia for more than two decades, made a similiar prediction, telling CNN his university’s policy changes are simply likely to make student protesters change their methods.

“I suspect this is going to lead student activists to turn to other forms of protest – more covert, more radical,” Eyal said. He also questions whether the university can enforce all of its new security restrictions: “Suppose protesters appear wearing masks and claiming religious or health exemptions? What will the university do?”

Virginia Page Fortna, a professor of US foreign and security policy at Columbia, agrees. She told CNN she’s already seen public political activity on the Israel-Palestinian issue begin to quiet — but said that might not last.

“Cracking down on protest often has the opposite effect — galvanizing and even radicalizing people. And we could see widespread protest against the university’s approach to the current crisis. So we will have to wait to see how this plays out,” Fortna said.

Pushback over the protest crackdown is already starting to materialize at other universities.

On March 19, students and faculty at UC Berkeley rallied to protest the Trump administration’s actions aimed at universities, according to CNN affiliate KPIX. UC Berkeley has a long history of high-profile student activism. In the 1960s it was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, a prominent group of student activists who pushed for broad freedom of expression.

One UCLA student who asked to remain anonymous argues student protests will endure regardless of how unpopular activist movements may be in their own time. The student points to her own university’s history of cracking down on Vietnam War protesters and the controversial, on-campus deaths of two students who were members of the Black Panther Party in 1969.

“Student activists will continue fighting for justice regardless of their university and their university’s donors’ opinions,” she said.

Student and faculty unions have emerged at the forefront of new resistance to the Trump administration, both in the streets and in court.

Last week, labor unions representing professors and other educators sued the Department of Education, the Department of Homeland Security and several other government agencies over the revocation of $400 million in funding to Columbia. The lawsuit calls the Trump administration’s actions an “unlawful and unprecedented effort to overpower a university’s academic autonomy and control the thought, association, scholarship, and expression of its faculty and students.”

A week ago, a rally was held on the steps of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services Building in downtown Minneapolis to protest the detention of a University of Minnesota graduate student by ICE officers. The rally included union presidents who represent graduate workers at more than half a dozen universities, including Stanford and Northwestern, according to a statement from the union leaders.

The graduate workers’ unions argue that the “constitutional violations” taking place against international university students “are part of a larger plan to continue stripping our rights away from us…it will not stop there.” The rallygoers called for solidarity among institutions in higher education and condemned universities that comply with what they call the administration’s “illegal and unconstitutional orders.”

Sebastian Spitz, a PhD student and Harvard Law graduate, told CNN unions have a long history of mobilizing for change on campuses, pointing to wage increases he helped push for with Harvard’s Graduate Student Union.

The union used “strikes, disruption and negative media attention,” to pressure Harvard into realizing “that raising our wages was in its interests,” Spitz said. He believes activists should employ similar tactics now.

“Universities must speak out against these assaults. They must do so collectively, with other civic organizations,” he said, stressing the need to make the message accessible beyond the rarefied air of the Ivy League. “The vast majority of Americans did not go to Harvard and do not care what (Harvard University) President (Alan) Garber thinks.”

Scheppele also stressed the importance of appealing to all Americans and making sure the public understands “the importance of our work for a democratic society.”

“We have allowed for too long the extremists in this country to define us as a woke mob indoctrinating children,” Scheppele said.

Neil Fligstein, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, is critical of the lack of unity among university presidents, particularly those leading top-tier institutions.

“As long as Trump picks on one university at a time…he puts their leaders in the position of having to sacrifice their organization or capitulate. So far, capitulate is winning,” he said.

For students like Maria, activism remains a blend of realism and optimism.

“The drive to achieve something bigger and better has always shaped my motives,” she said. Now, she believes it’s up to individuals to decide whether to defend the country’s basic rights and core values – or do nothing and risk them being stripped away.",Left

Military families who are deployed far from their homes will see their process for voting become more complex, risking their possible disenfranchisement, with President Donald Trump’s efforts to make certain election policies more stringent.

Trump’s new executive order — which aims to boost proof-of-citizenship requirements and to pressure states to make other changes to their election practices — comes as military voters are already caught in the middle of legal battles over Republican efforts to toss overseas ballots. A Friday court ruling, for example, has jeopardized thousands of overseas ballots cast in a North Carolina Supreme Court race last year.

Trump is now seeking to unilaterally revamp election policies to bring them in line with conservative goals, signing the March executive order that tries to implement policies that Republicans have not been able to achieve legislatively or through the courts.

The military vote has long been seen as sacrosanct politically, and 1986 legislation that sought to clear some obstacles service members face passed with broad bipartisan support. However, the unfounded fixation by Trump and his allies on mass election fraud has translated into efforts that could disenfranchise those serving the nation’s interests abroad.

Critics of the Trump order say members of the military stationed away from their home states may not have easy access to the types of documents the order seeks to require for registering to vote. Even if they do, finding a way to securely transmit those documents to election officials could be difficult. Additionally, Trump is targeting states’ practice of counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day if properly postmarked — a practice that is extended to military and overseas voters in nearly three-dozen states.

“This order just doesn’t take into account our lived experiences and inadvertently creates unnecessary barriers for folks in the military or overseas,” said Sarah Streyder, a military spouse stationed in the United Kingdom and executive directive of the Secure Families Initiative, a military families organization challenging the order in court.

Supporters of Trump’s order say the concerns are overblown.

“When you’re an American abroad, you don’t let your passport out of your sight,” said Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation who is a proponent of such requirements. He argued the Pentagon could also order that the military IDs distributed to service members and their families include citizenship information.

The Defense Department declined to answer CNN’s questions about its plans for implementing Trump’s order.

The White House did not respond to specific questions about the order, but in a statement, spokesperson Anna Kelly said, “President Trump cares deeply about our active duty servicemembers and their families, and he wants to ensure the right of every eligible citizen to vote while preserving election integrity.”

The key provisions of the Uniformed and Overseas Voting Act, or UOCAVA — the 1986 law that eased the process for military and overseas voters — covers both military members abroad and those stationed domestically who need to vote absentee. Not every unformed service member covered under the law would necessarily have a passport.

Trump is seeking to use federal funding and other tools in his arsenal to push states toward his desired election policies. But it is local and state election officials who determine how voting works in their jurisdictions, and the complexities of that state-by-state process is in part why Congress passed the act. The military community accounted for a little less than half of the 1.2 million Americans who were registered under the law in 2020.

Still, 4 out of 5 overseas Americans who did not return a ballot in 2020 said it was because they couldn’t complete the process, according to survey data released by the Defense Department office that helps military families with voting.

“I’ve never heard a single election official have anything but tremendous concern for challenges that those serving American interests overseas might be facing until recently,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department attorney who now leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research, which advises election administrators of both parties.

‘If there’s not a secure way to send this, it shouldn’t be implemented’

With his lack of authority over state election registration rules, Trump’s actions to bolster a proof-of-citizenship requirement are aimed at the federal forms that are widely available for Americans to use for voter registration.

Trump directed the Defense Department to add a requirement for documents proving one’s citizenship to the registration postcard that military families and overseas civilians can use to register. His order identifies a short list of documents that would meet the requirement but does not explicitly say that a birth certificate would be enough.

Steyder, of the military families organization, says it shouldn’t be assumed that military families would have an easy time getting their hands on those records, particularly given how chaotic the moving process can be for deployments. State election officials are required to honor the federal postcard application only for a calendar year, and the postcard also must be resubmitted every time the voter moves, Streyder said.

In 2024, her presidential primary ballot was cast from South Korea, her regular primary ballot was cast stateside as she prepared for another move, and her general election ballot was cast from her husband’s current station in the United Kingdom.

“That’s three different postcard applications, three different absentee ballots,” Streyder said.

Overseas voters can use the registration procedures of their home states, but the postcard is supposed to serve as failsafe for those having trouble navigating the process. In 2020, 764,000 voters used the postcard to register — with one-third of those being uniformed service members. That represented a major increase in use over past elections.

Even if those documents are easily at hand, how military voters can submit them to election officials presents its own challenges, since computers and scanners might not be readily accessible where they’re stationed. Streyder raised concerns about security vulnerabilities for transmitting sensitive personal information — particularly for those in roles making them a target — if an overseas voter didn’t have access to a trusted device.

“This can’t be done unless security issues are dealt with,” Becker said. “And so, if there’s not a secure way to send this, it shouldn’t be implemented.”

Delays in the mail

The most common reason UOCAVA ballots are rejected is that they arrived after a state’s deadline to be counted. Of the ballots cast by military members that were rejected in 2020, almost half were thrown out for that reason. That’s despite federal law requiring election officials send out overseas absentee ballots at least 45 days before an election.

Though UOCAVA doesn’t require it, several states provide overseas and military voters extra time after Election Day for their mail-in ballots to arrive.

The legal challengers to Trump’s order accuse him of putting those ballots at risk as well.

The president exempts UOCAVA ballots from his instruction that the US Election Assistance Commission withhold federal funding from states that count mail-in ballots received after Election Day. But no such exemption exists in a separate, ambiguously worded directive that the attorney general “shall take all necessary action to enforce” an Election Day receipt deadline for mail-in ballots to be counted.

Regardless, von Spakovsky argued the 45 days that UOCAVA provides before Election Day is enough time.

But Streyder said that given the lengthy international mail times, even a highly proactive overseas voter who returns their ballot as soon as they receive it may not see that ballot make it back by Election Day.

Given the limited time absentee military voters already have to make sure their mail-in ballots make it back in time, they “do not have as much time to be maximally deliberative and thoughtful and researched,” particularly when developments in the final weeks of the campaign could change their vote.

“And we have the audacity to believe that that’s not fair either,” she said.

Not long after a federal ruling dismissed criminal charges against him, a visibly relieved Mayor Eric Adams summoned the press to the entrance of Gracie Mansion where he thanked two people — his $2,000-an-hour celebrity lawyer, Alex Spiro, and Jesus Christ — for steering him out of a case that could have sent Adams to prison for decades. The very next day, Adams dropped out of the June primary for mayor, vowing to run as an independent in November against whichever Democrat wins.

“As I’ve said all along, this case should have never been brought,” insisted Hizzoner. Tellingly, the mayor neither thanked nor mentioned Judge Dale Ho, the man whose 78-page ruling actually dismissed United States v. Eric Adams. Ho strongly condemns the Trump administration’s Department of Justice for arguing that the case should be dropped without any reference to Adams’s guilt or innocence but because the mayor would be useful in implementing Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Adams will surely continue telling audiences that he was the innocent victim of politically motivated prosecutors, although Ho explicitly found the opposite, writing that “everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.”

The mayor will also likely continue spreading the fiction that he has been fully exonerated, which is far from true: Trump’s Justice Department — over the objections of half a dozen prosecutors who resigned in protest — simply chose not to assess evidence of Adam’s guilt or innocence. In plain English, Ho concluded that the place to deal with the actions of Adams and/or the Trump administration is the voting booth, not the courtroom. So it falls to New Yorkers to insist that our leaders rise to a higher standard than “I was never convicted.”

Parents spend years teaching their children lessons about character by stressing how important it is to be hardworking and dependable, always tell the truth, protect the less fortunate, and own up to one’s mistakes even when the results are likely to cause embarrassment or ridicule.

Maybe this should be the year we adopt the same standard for politicians — and apply them in the mayoral race.

Adams’s legal ordeal has vanished just in time for the beauty-contest phase of the race, with most candidates attending a string of forums, debates, and question-and-answer sessions. Many of the events are theme-based, focused discussions of the issues most important to the host, such as housing, education, public safety, environmental justice, and the like.

But nowhere do we directly grill the candidates about questions of character that voters need answered before Election Day. I, for one, would love to get answers to questions like: Are you an honest person? Are you a man or woman of your word? Have you ever made an unpopular decision under difficult circumstances? Do you respond with sympathy and kindness to people in need? Is public service a calling, or are you chasing the perks, privileges, and paychecks of high office?

“I did nothing wrong,” Mayor Adams says frequently about the years of free, undisclosed air travel and luxury accommodations he accepted from businessmen with ties to foreign governments, the conduct that led to his indictment. Does that mean you did everything right, Mr. Mayor? And should we expect more of the same if you get reelected?

Similar questions should be put to Adams’s competitor, ex-governor Andrew Cuomo, who in the past made quasi-apologetic statements about the various women who claim he harassed them but now falls back on the basement-level standard of never having been charged or convicted. Exhaustive reporting of the original damning state attorney general’s report on Cuomo makes clear that the 11 women who accused Cuomo of harassment had varying levels of credibility; voters can make up their own minds about the veracity of the different accounts.

But the harassment accusations aren’t the only terrible behavior Cuomo has been accused of over the years. We have credible reports of him screaming and cursing at some officials, threatening others, and creating a toxic workplace. His difficult but defensible actions in the early days of the pandemic were followed by so many evasive and contradictory statements that Cuomo currently stands accused of making false statements to Congress. Are voters supposed to ignore this?

An additional set of ethical questions comes up when it comes to corruption questions that dogged the Cuomo administration, from the Moreland Commission that he created and then abruptly shut down to the Buffalo Billions bid-rigging case that, incredibly, is still kicking around the courts, with former SUNY Polytechnic president Alain Kaloyeros fighting against the prospect of a second trial after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his original conviction. There are plenty of questions out there, but Cuomo is carefully limiting his appearances, skipping forums, and generally avoiding situations in which questions might be asked.

“At least for now, Cuomo is running for public office mostly away from the public,” Newsday notes. “His events are barely announced or unannounced entirely, the guest lists curated, encounters otherwise by happenstance, and security tight.” But that won’t last forever, and it shouldn’t. Voters have not just the right but the obligation to get answers about the past actions of Cuomo, Adams, and all other candidates — and to draw conclusions about the character of the people who want to lead us.

New Yorkers generally don’t pass judgment on the personal lives of our neighbors; it’s considered gauche. But the same tolerant, mind-your-own-business attitude that enables 8 million of us to live in close proximity is guaranteed to backfire if we elevate officeholders who turn out to be careless, cowardly, or corrupt. The biblical admonition to “judge not, lest you be judged” should not be watered down into a childish “live and let live” apathy when it comes to the grown-up business of giving our fellow citizens the awesome powers of government that are literally matters of life and death.

The recent Trump administration national security leak, exposed by Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic, is a perfect case in point, as the novelist and Marine Corps veteran Phil Klay argued in a New York Times op-ed. “As the Trump administration has responded with a mixture of denials, brush-offs, lies and vitriolic attacks on Mr. Goldberg, I’ve found myself worrying less about the leak and more about the character of the people in charge of our nation’s defense,” Klay writes. “The breach is serious, but security breaches can be plugged. Men and women who have shown themselves to have no character, though, can never be trusted. Not with national security, not with anything.”

New Yorkers have seen the downside of a mayor who has tolerated, benefited from, and occasionally created red-flag ethical problems, including nepotism; telling tall tales about his past that in at least one case included enlisting city workers to support an elaborate lie; elevating and supporting aides accused of misconduct; failing to make mandatory disclosures of personal gifts; and multiple instances of receiving illegal campaign donations. Adams tends to wave away these problems by pronouncing himself “perfectly imperfect,” a self-exoneration that avoids the hard truth New Yorkers now face: How do we make sure the leader of our city doesn’t need the threat of prosecutors and investigators to behave like a decent person?",Left

PARAMUS, N.J. -- Democratic Sen. Cory Booker took a version of his record-breaking Senate floor speech on the road Saturday to a town hall meeting in a New Jersey gymnasium, calling on people to find out what they can do to push back on President Donald Trump's agenda.

Booker took questions at suburban New Jersey's Bergen Community College the same day as more than 1,200 “Hands Off!” demonstrations were planned around the country. The town hall event was punctuated both by celebratory shouts of “Cory, Cory” as well as at least a half-dozen interruptions by protesters.

It was Booker's first in-person event in his home state since his speech this week, where he held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes in opposition to Trump's policies. In doing so, he broke the record for the longest floor speech, which was set by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

Questioner after questioner asked what they could be doing to show their disagreement and worry over the president's policies. Booker told them it only takes a little bit more — could they afford a trip to Washington to lobby against budget cuts? One of the loudest moments of applause came after he addressed a woman who said she worried about what potential Medicaid cuts could mean for her son with autism.

“A gathering like this can’t be the end of our activism,” Booker said. “This has got to be a moment in America where all of us begin to say, what more can I do?”

The questions and Booker's response mirror what voters and other Democrats have been hearing during town halls. He said he didn't want to focus on the Democratic Party, which has struggled to find a message since losing the 2024 election. Instead, he said, he would focus on “the people of our country.”

“I think the Democratic Party lost a lot of elections because people didn’t believe that they cared about them. So let’s stop worrying about the politics and get more focused on the people,” Booker said.

Lisa Dunn, 41, a special education teacher and social worker from Jersey City, attended the rainy Saturday event because she worried that the Trump administration's policies are beginning to impact people. She credited Booker for the Senate speech, saying at least “he's doing something.”

She said she wishes there was a specific action to take, but she understands why there isn't.

“I wish there was something very concrete. However, personally, I am listening. I’m taking in information. I’m trying to figure out where do I stand right now in terms of what I actually can do and what will make the most impact,” she said. “So part of me does understand that answer because I assume that probably politicians are in the same boat.”

After the event, Booker said he was reluctant to tell people the exact tactics to use, citing civil rights activists like the late John Lewis. He said creativity has a role to play.

“I know one thing it’s not is sitting down and doing nothing and just watching on TV and getting stuck in a state of sedentary agitation,” he said. “Everybody has to be taking measures to put the pressure on to change.”

Booker, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020, said after the event that he was focused on running for reelection to the Senate in 2026 and that 2028 “will take care of itself.”

Booker, 55, is in his second full term in the Senate. He chairs the Strategic Communications Committee, his party's messaging arm. His team is focused on boosting Senate Democrats’ presence across social platforms through more frequent and casual content.

Booker himself has amassed one of the largest followings on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X, where his commentary appears to connect with the party's base. But staffers are now focused on how to transfer that success to Booker’s fellow senators, who are often less digitally fluent and face different political landscapes in their home states.

That has involved turning the communications committee into a nerve center for testing and coordinating the easiest-to-use formats for lawmakers looking to boost their digital brands.

Booker hopes to double the engagement senators receive with their content directly online and increase the caucus’ appearances with online digital media personalities.

The start of Saturday's event included six disruptions, including by several people who decried the treatment of Palestinians. Police in the gymnasium escorted them from the arena.

“I hear you and I see you,” Booker said.

WASHINGTON -- After hiding in Thailand for seven years, two Cambodian journalists arrived in the United States last year on work visas, aiming to keep providing people in their Southeast Asian homeland with objective, factual news through Radio Free Asia.

But Vuthy Tha and Hour Hum now say their jobs and legal status in the U.S. are at risk after President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order gutting the government-run U.S. Agency for Global Media. The agency funds Radio Free Asia and other outlets tasked with delivering uncensored information to parts of the world under authoritarian rule and often without a free press of their own.

“It fell out of sky,” Vuthy, a single father of two small children, said through a translator about the Trump administration's decision, which he says threatens to upend his life.

“I am very regretful that our listeners cannot receive the accurate news,” Hour said, also through a translator.

Both men said they're worried about providing for their families and being allowed to stay in the U.S. They say it's impossible to return to Cambodia, a single-party state hostile to independent media where they fear being persecuted for their journalistic work.

The administration has been dismantling or slashing the size of federal agencies, leading tens of thousands of government workers and contractors to be fired or put on leave. But the targeting of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, whose decades-old networks aim to extend American influence abroad, means journalists who have defied authoritarian regimes to help fulfill a U.S. mission of delivering pro-democracy programming could be deported and face harassment and persecution in their homelands.

Eleven journalists associated with the U.S.-funded media outlets are behind bars overseas, including RFA's Shin Daewe, who is serving 15 years in Myanmar on a charge of supporting terrorism.

At least 84 U.S. Agency for Global Media, or USAGM, journalists in the United States on work visas could face deportation, including at least 23 “at serious risk of being immediately arrested upon arrival and potentially imprisoned,"" according to the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders and a coalition of 36 human rights organizations.

“It is outrageous that these journalists, who risk their lives to expose the extent of repression in their home countries, might be completely abandoned,"" said Thibaut Bruttin, director general of Reporters Without Borders.

“The U.S. Congress must take responsibility for protecting these reporters and all USAGM-funded outlets, funded by Congress itself,” Bruttin said. “This responsibility is not just moral — it stems from the United States’ commitment to defending the principles of democracy and press freedom.”

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee did not respond to requests for comment. The White House did not comment.

The State Department said it is coordinating with USAGM on imprisoned journalists and that it condemns unjust detentions of journalists for exercising their freedom of expression.

A number of journalists for Voice of America, a news service also overseen by USAGM, have sued in a federal court. That includes two unnamed foreign journalists on temporary visas.

If deported, one could risk imprisonment for 10 years for his work for VOA, and the other, a member of a persecuted minority in his home country, could be in “physical danger,"" the lawsuit said.

The court has temporarily halted contract terminations, preventing the visa holders from being forced to leave for now.

Both RFA and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, another USAGM-funded media outlet, also have sued seeking restoration of funding.

Trump's cuts come after the U.S. last year helped free Alsu Kurmasheva — a dual U.S.-Russian citizen and journalist with RFE/RL — in a high-profile prisoner swap that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.

In February, the Trump administration announced the release of Andrey Kuznechyk, a Belarusian journalist with RFE/RL’s Belarus service. The network still has four journalists jailed — one each in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Russia-occupied Crimea.

Voice of America has a contributor jailed in Myanmar and another in Vietnam, said Jessica Jerreat, VOA's press freedom editor.

In Vietnam, four RFA reporters are in jail and another is under house arrest, according to Tamara Bralo, the outlet's head of journalist security. She said she's concerned that American support in seeking their release could diminish if RFA folds.

Vietnam consistently ranks near the bottom in the Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, which says about 40 journalists are held in Vietnam's prisons where mistreatment is widespread.

Khoa Lai, a Vietnamese journalist who joined RFA in Washington on a work visa only days before Trump took office, said returning to Vietnam is risky for him.

“I could face prosecution or be in prison,” said Lai, who produces video stories on freedom of speech, freedom of religion and political corruption for RFA's Vietnamese service. “I don't know for sure, but it won't be good.""

Both Vuthy and Hour began working for RFA in Cambodia but had to leave in 2017 when Cambodia's top court dissolved the main opposition CNRP party, authorities arrested their colleagues and RFA closed its office.

In neighboring Thailand as refugees, both continued to report for RFA, but with their identities hidden. They still risked getting sent back to Cambodia until RFA brought them to the U.S. on work visas last year. They have reported on issues ranging from politics, corruption and human rights to climate change and environment.

Cambodia’s autocratic former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ruled his country for nearly four decades and passed power to his son Hun Manet, praised Trump in a Facebook post for “having the courage to lead the world to combat fake news” by cutting funding to USAGM.

Vuthy says he's still hopeful that RFA might survive, adding that it “is fighting for its existence.""

On Saturday, in towns and cities in all 50 states, protesters took to the streets to express their opposition to Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the never-ending transgressions of the second Trump administration — as well as show their support for federal workers, immigrants, trans people, and numerous other groups and causes now being targeted by the government. Taken together, the “Hands Off!” protests were the largest act of defiance yet against Trump’s second presidency and came after a particularly tumultuous week in which Trump single-handedly destabilized the U.S. economy with his new sweeping tariff policies. Below, in alphabetical order, are scenes (and some of the signs) from dozens of Saturday’s protests.

The textbooks warned us. They said if a country tried to impose tariffs, other countries would retaliate. A trade war would break out. Prices would rise, trade would collapse, and everyone would lose.

But something strange happened.

Donald Trump imposed tariffs, and the world adjusted. There was no collapse. The retaliation never came, except from China. Countries didn’t escalate. They negotiated. They offered concessions. Many simply accepted the new baseline. And some even reduced their own tariffs in response.

The globalists were wrong. The classical economists were right. And Trump’s tariffs are proving it.

To understand what’s happening, let’s return to the theory we explored in Part One of this series—the optimum tariff. The logic was simple: when a country with market power imposes a moderate tariff, it buys imports at a lower world price and shifts the terms of trade in its favor. That country ends up better off, so long as others don’t retaliate in kind.

This theory had always been dismissed as “too theoretical.” The assumption was that retaliation would be automatic and destructive, making any gain short-lived.

But the real world doesn’t follow academic assumptions. It follows power. And America has it.

Trump’s Baseline Tariff: A Modern Optimum Tariff

Trump’s proposal of a 10 percent universal tariff on all imports is a textbook example of an optimum tariff—only with more strategic elegance. Unlike targeted tariffs that might hit one country or sector, a universal tariff reduces distortion and raises revenue while pushing down global prices across a wide range of goods. It isn’t aimed at retaliation. It’s aimed at realigning the terms of trade—to ensure the U.S. no longer subsidizes global production at the expense of its own industries.

And it’s working precisely because America is the world’s buyer of last resort. We are the final destination for the world’s exports. Every producer, every exporter, every multinational needs access to the U.S. market. That’s why a 10 percent tariff doesn’t just raise money—it reshapes global incentives.

When the Trump administration proposed this tariff, most countries didn’t threaten retaliation. They opened trade talks. They looked for exemptions. They sought deals. In other words, they accepted America’s leverage.

That’s what the optimum tariff theory predicted. That’s exactly what is playing out.

Reciprocal Tariffs: A Targeted Application of Leverage

Then there’s the reciprocal tariff formula—another Trump innovation that makes the theory even more enforceable. If a foreign country imposes a 25 percent tariff on American goods, we match it with a 25 percent tariff on theirs. Simple. Fair. Rational.

But underneath its simplicity is a deep strategic logic. The reciprocal tariff isn’t just a tit-for-tat move—it’s a threat with teeth. It tells foreign nations: if you want access to our market, you must grant us equal access to yours.

That’s not protectionism. That’s economic justice and economic strategy. And it works.

What we’ve seen over the past several years is not a spiraling trade war, but a gradual realignment of global trading rules in favor of the United States. Countries that once relied on high tariffs to protect their markets—from Europe to India to South Korea—are coming to the table. They’re negotiating. They’re reforming. Why? Because they know they need the American consumer more than America needs their exports.

The assumption that retaliation would cancel out the benefits of tariffs has proven false. And this isn’t a fluke—it’s a reflection of the structure of global trade. The U.S. is uniquely positioned to benefit from the optimum tariff because the world is not symmetrical. We buy more than we sell. We are the hub, not a spoke.

What the Economists Missed

The classical theorists who developed optimum tariff theory understood this in theory but feared it in practice. They worried that even modest tariffs would provoke tit-for-tat retaliation, leading to declining trade and falling incomes.

But they were writing in a world of relatively equal powers. That’s not today’s world.

Today, most nations are not in a position to retaliate effectively. Many of them depend on trade surpluses with the U.S. to keep their own economies afloat. Retaliation would be an act of self-sabotage. The only country that responded with real counter-tariffs was China—and the result was not American collapse, but the decoupling of supply chains, the reshoring of industry, and a rebirth of American manufacturing power.

The Political Economy of Strength

Tariffs are not just about prices. They are about bargaining power. And when used wisely, they are also about rebuilding national strength.

A tariff does not need to raise prices for consumers if the world lowers its prices to retain access to the U.S. market. A tariff does not need to reduce trade if it leads to better deals. And a tariff does not need to spark inflation if foreign exporters eat the margin—as they often do.

But what a tariff does do—when designed properly—is restore industrial capacity, support good-paying jobs, and tilt global economic flows back toward the American worker.

This is the real meaning of optimum tariff theory: not an academic formula, but a recognition that trade is not neutral. It is power. It is politics. And if we refuse to use our leverage, someone else will.

The Global Realignment Has Begun

What we are witnessing under Trump’s trade policy is not isolationism. It’s a restructuring of the rules of globalization.

The 10 percent tariff isn’t just a number—it’s a signal. It tells the world: America will no longer offer unconditional access to its market. Trade must now be fair, reciprocal, and beneficial to the nation as a whole. The old free trade dogma—built on the myth of mutual gain—is giving way to a harder, smarter economics grounded in real-world leverage.

The retaliation never came because most countries couldn’t afford to bring it. And in their silence, we hear the quiet sound of an economic order being reset.

Call it protectionism if you like. But the proper name is older and more precise.

It’s called the optimum tariff. And at long last, it’s being put to work for America.",Right

The 2026 Senate map starts to take shape

The next battle for the Senate majority has come into clearer focus in recent weeks, with candidates in both parties making their intentions known in high-profile races across the map.

As Bridget Bowman reports, Democrats face an uphill climb to take control of the chamber in the 2026 elections: The party must reach into GOP territory to net the four seats they need, while also defending competitive seats in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to expand their 53-47 majority while defending blue-leaning Maine and battleground North Carolina.

Here’s the latest on who’s in, who’s out and who still needs to make a decision in the top Senate contests of the cycle.

Michigan: The latest piece of the puzzle fell into place Monday, with former Rep. Mike Rogers becoming the first major Republican to jump into the Michigan Senate race. He quickly snagged endorsements from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott. Rogers lost to Democrat Elissa Slotkin in last year’s Senate race by less than 1 percentage point.

On the Democratic side, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow entered the race to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters last week. Several other Democrats, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former Wayne County health director Abdul El-Sayed, are also considering bids.

New Hampshire: Former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced last week he would not run for Senate, despite encouragement from President Donald Trump. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown is weighing a bid in the state, where he lost a 2014 Senate race.

Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas launched his Senate campaign last week, and fellow Rep. Maggie Goodlander is also still considering a run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

North Carolina: While former Rep. Wiley Nickel announced last week he would take on Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, Democrats are waiting on former Gov. Roy Cooper to decide if will run against one of the party’s top targets next year.

Maine: It’s a similar story for the party in Maine, with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills not ruling out a campaign against GOP Sen. Susan Collins. Democrats have struggled to defeat Collins even as they’ve consistently carried Maine at the presidential level.

Georgia: Likewise, the GOP is waiting on a major shoe to drop in Georgia. National Republicans have been recruiting Gov. Brian Kemp to run against Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, one of their top targets on the map. If he doesn’t, it would likely open the floodgates for Republicans to enter the contest.

Homeward bound: We could see more campaign announcements over the two-week congressional recess, with lawmakers back in their home states and districts.

Alexandra Marquez reports that Republicans are largely avoiding holding in-person town halls during this period, as National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson has advised. According to news releases and publicly posted event notices, the majority of town halls and town hall-style events taking place over the congressional recess will be hosted by Democrats.

Youth movement: In addition to the battleground races, there’s also activity bubbling up in Democratic primaries amid dissatisfaction from the base over the direction of the party. Faith Wardwell and Elias Miller write that a crop of candidates in their 20s and 30s is stepping in to challenge older Democrats for their seats in Congress.

A growing number of Republicans identify with the MAGA movement

By Ben Kamisar

Recent polling from NBC News shows how President Donald Trump has consolidated the Republican Party not just around himself, but also around his broader “Make America Great Again” movement.

Thirty-six percent of registered voters identified themselves as MAGA supporters in an NBC News poll conducted in March. It’s a significant increase from past polling — up from 23% of respondents in a merged sample of all of NBC News’ polling throughout 2023, and 27% of respondents in a merged sample of 2024 polling.

The overall share is powered by the 71% of Republicans who now call themselves MAGA supporters.

NBC News’ polling already showed signs of a shift afoot between the beginning of the 2024 presidential primary and the final weeks before Election Day, as the GOP consolidated around Trump. In January 2024, days after Trump won nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, just 20% of registered voters said they aligned with the MAGA movement. But in NBC News’ combined polling in October and early November 2024, that number ticked up to 29%.

A shift among Republicans moving more into Trump’s camp is primarily driving this movement, with a 16-point increase in GOPers identifying with the MAGA movement between the two polls right before the 2024 election (55%) and March this year (71%). There’s also been a similar shift among college-educated men, from 21% in 2024 to 37% in March — also a 16-point increase.

It’s the kind of pro-Trump consolidation that led to him matching his best-ever approval rating (47%) in NBC News’ March poll, though a majority of registered voters, 51%, still disapproved of his job performance.

“All of that shift is coming from Republicans,” said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies who conducted the survey along with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, of Hart Research Associates.

Much of the nihilistic destructiveness and rage unleashed by the second Trump administration has been understandably attributed to the intense and wide-ranging grievances of the 47th president. Donald Trump’s unlikely comeback from the failed post-election coup of 2021 was fueled by his determination to settle scores with the many individuals and institutions that had thwarted him as president and pursued him in the courts and in the media as ex-president.

But while it’s no surprise that some of Trump’s closest associates share his thirst for vengeance and desire to gloat over the supine figures of their vanquished enemies, there’s something deeply personal about the entire MAGA drive to destabilize the country that cannot really be explained by vicarious enjoyment of Trump’s comeuppance of his detractors. The targets of his veritable explosion of executive actions are much broader than any identifiable group of Democratic or Establishment Republican activists, or anyone complicit in the alleged “stolen election” of 2020 or the alleged legal persecutions of 2023 and 2024. And there’s a growing suspicion that an entire class of Americans is being targeted for political, cultural, and perhaps economic extinction as part of Trump’s vengeance tour, as Franklin Foer discussed in The Atlantic:

The target of the administration’s campaign is a stratum of society that’s sometimes called the professional managerial class, or the PMC, although there’s not one universal moniker that MAGA applies to the group it is now crushing. That group includes society’s knowledge workers, its cognitive elite, the winners of the tournament that is the American meritocracy. It covers not only lawyers, university administrators, and professors, but also consultants, investment bankers, scientists, journalists, and other white-collar workers who have prospered in the information age.

In other words, there’s a pattern that connects the attacks on funding of university-based research, the shakedowns of white-shoe law firms, the ongoing threats to non-MAGA media, the effort to control corporate HR policies, the crackdown on inconvenient sources of data, and above all, the furious Elon Musk–Russell Vought assault on the federal employees and contractors. Indeed, the characteristic lawlessness of Trump 2.0 and the wild extremist rhetoric accompanying many of its actions is more consistent with a project of class warfare than any merely partisan or ideological agenda.

It’s no secret, of course, that there’s a long and terrible tradition in right-wing authoritarian politics of intense hostility to allegedly self-serving and disloyal “elites” that have to be demolished so that a given nation, race, or culture can thrive. In early 20th-century Europe, financial, academic, professional, and bureaucratic elements — which were thought to be disproportionately Jewish and “cosmopolitan” — were treated as the incorrigible enemy of truly productive capitalists, workers, and peasants alike. Thus they had to be crushed by any available means, legal or extralegal. And as Foer observes, there’s a less lethal but still distinctive U.S. conservative tradition of animosity toward the so-called PMC, often described as creating a government-dependent underclass in an unholy alliance of parasites feeding off the work of productive and patriotic Americans. That sort of thinking has gone viral in Trump 2.0:

Animosity to the PMC is a propulsive force in Trump’s second term. Rather than merely replacing its ideological foes—by installing its own appointees in federal agencies—the administration is bent on destroying their institutional homes, and the basis for their livelihood. That’s the lesson of the Department of Government Efficiency.

What gave this anti-elitism a lot of its political oomph is the working-class sense of betrayal at the financial experts’ bungling of the U.S. economy early in the 21st century, and the scientific experts’ overreach during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it’s not just elite-hating working stiffs who have made Trump’s enemies their own and turned his vengeance into a full-blown political agenda. There are Trump’s billionaire backers who see a heaven-sent opportunity to disable the bureaucratic restraints on their own wealth and power. And there are the technocratic engineers who view bureaucratic desk jockeys as useless cannon fodder in the coming transformation of all work by AI, notes Foer:

Elon Musk, for one, adopted a … disdain for the PMC as a business plan. When he took over Twitter in 2022, he laid off 80 percent of the workforce, including the Trust and Safety Council and a chunk of the company’s content moderators. As the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Antonio García Martínez put it, Musk was taking a stand against “the professional-managerial class regime that otherwise elsewhere dominates.” Not only did he treat this caste with disdain; he implied that it was doomed to the dustbin of history, because its members’ functions could be so easily subsumed by artificial intelligence. A shared hatred of the PMC drew Musk to Trump, and the Twitter purge foreshadowed Musk’s approach in government.

Closely connected to the Trump-Musk class war on pencil-pushers is the administration’s economic plans, focused currently on a tariff agenda designed to shift America’s productive center from services and “knowledge” products back to manufacturing. In many of the not-so-far reaches of MAGA-land, there is also envisioned a concomitant reallocation of human resources from the public sector, academia, and the media to factory work for men and domestic occupations for women. Some alarmed observers have compared the whole scheme to Mao’s infamous campaign to force students and other intellectuals to work on farms and in factories during China’s Cultural Revolution. Then as now the driving force was the belief that an entire class of citizens was inherently disloyal and engaged in work inimical to the regime’s radical goals. If it’s true or even half-true, it helps explain the peculiar savagery of Trump 2.0 and its disdain for both structural limitations on its power and for any downside consequences of poorly executed actions. As in a Marxist revolution, virtue is found in the class struggle itself.

What’s most worrying about this interpretation of events is that it doesn’t suggest there will be any self-correcting process for restraining MAGA excesses. A 78-year-old narcissist in the final stage of life aligned with a band of self-conscious revolutionaries seeking in their own fevered minds to save civilization are not going to be deterred much by public-opinion polls, midterm elections, or perhaps even court rulings. This is a very personal fight against people whose opposition to American Greatness cannot be tolerated for long.",Left

A Maryland man’s efforts to return to the US after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month hit a major new roadblock on Monday when the country’s president vowed to keep the father of three locked in a notorious mega-prison.

The comments from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele mark a key turning point in the legal saga over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who has become a political pawn in the Trump administration’s quest to dramatically expand the power of the presidency over immigration matters as President Donald Trump pursues a deportation campaign.

During a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, Bukele told reporters that while he has the power to release Abrego Garcia, his administration isn’t “very fond of releasing terrorists” being detained in his country.

US officials have alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. His attorneys, however, dispute the claim and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward it.

Here’s what to know about the case.

Who is Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, entered the US illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019, after reviewing evidence, withheld his removal. That meant he could not be deported to El Salvador but could be deported to another country. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family’s pupusa business.”

US officials arrested Abrego Garcia on March 12 and placed him on one of three planes bound for El Salvador days later. The administration alleges that he was arrested “in the company of other ranking gang members” and that he was confirmed to be a member of MS-13 by a “reliable source.”

Abrego Garcia was later identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison known as CECOT.

How have federal courts responded?

Late last month, Abrego Garcia and his family sued various Trump administration officials to secure his return to the US. District Judge Paula Xinis, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said his removal to El Salvador was “an illegal act” and ordered the government to facilitate his return to the US by 11:59 p.m. on March 31.

After appeals, the Supreme Court put Xinis’ deadline on hold and later backed her directive without setting a new deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned, saying instead that the district court judge’s edict was unclear and needed clarification.

The judge’s order, the high court said, “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”

Importantly, the Supreme Court noted that the clarification needed to be made with “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”

No justices publicly dissented from the court’s order, but its three liberal members wrote separately to criticize the administration’s actions in the case.

Removing ‘domestic obstacles’

After the case landed back before Xinis, the judge issued a new order for the administration to “take all available steps to facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return. She directed it to provide her with a sworn statement from an individual “with personal knowledge” of the steps the government has taken or is planning to take to secure his return.

The administration failed to submit the declaration, leading the judge to require the government to provide daily the same information each day so she can keep close tabs on how the administration is following her order.

Sunday night, Justice Department attorneys insisted that the government is not required to work with officials in El Salvador to secure Abrego Garcia’s return, arguing that they understand “facilitate” to mean working to “remove any domestic obstacles” that may stand in the way of his return.

“The federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” the DOJ attorneys wrote in the seven-page filing.

And as part of that day’s update to Xinis, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said in a sworn statement that Abrego Garcia “is no longer eligible for withholding of removal” because of the administration’s claim that he’s a member of the MS-13 gang.

The assertion by Evan Katz, an official with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, means that if Abrego Garcia were brought back to the US, the government would work quickly to deport him.

Another hearing in the case is set for Tuesday afternoon.

Oval Office rejection

Trump has shifted his stance on Abrego Garcia in recent days after initially saying he would abide by the Supreme Court’s decision.

“If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,” Trump told reporters last week.

But pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on those previous comments, the president on Monday did not answer the question, instead turning to members of his administration – including Attorney General Pam Bondi, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of State Marco Rubio — to underscore the administration’s argument that the US doesn’t have the power to return Abrego Garcia.

“That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, provide a plane,” Bondi said.

Minutes later, Bukele weighed in.

“I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” he said, prompting a reporter to ask whether he would release Abrego Garcia into El Salvador.

“You want us to us to go back to releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world?” Bukele said. “That’s not going to happen.”

Yellen, who chaired the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 prior to heading the Treasury from 2021 to 2025, took to CNBC’s Squawk Box to spew her anti-American rhetoric:

“Things have been just chaotic,” the former secretary said. “The reciprocal tariffs put on and paused … This is really creating an environment in which households and businesses feel paralyzed by the uncertainty about what’s going to happen — it makes planning almost impossible.”

At one point in the interview, she revealed that she does not believe in “American manufacturing”:

“Perhaps it’s to bring back American manufacturing, but I really think that’s a pipe dream, and not something that is likely to be accomplished,” she said, referring to Trump’s efforts to bring jobs back to the United States.

“And we could even raise questions about whether or not, in a broad-based way, that’s a desirable goal,” she added.

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris slammed Yellen’s remarks on X:

“The very same leftwing elites who are responsible for gutting our manufacturing base, screwing over our workers and building up the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote, “are upset because President Trump is committed to putting America First and ending their globalist agenda.”

In an interview Friday on CNN, Yellen called the Trump administration’s tariffs “the worst self-inflicted policy wound I’ve ever seen in my career inflicted on our economy.”

“The Trump tariff plans are doing immense damage to our economy,” she told host Anderson Cooper in her first television interview since Trump reentered presidential office.

Despite Yellen’s gloom-and-doom attitude and lack of support for American manufacturing, her latest statements came just as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia announced plans to build AI supercomputers in Texas and invest up to $500 billion in AI production within the United States.

“The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.”

The president confirmed the U.S. will hold more talks with Iran next Saturday in Italy, one week after the first talks began in Oman. 
Details of the discussion remain nil, though they were seen as a launching point as Washington tries to negotiate with Tehran to end its nuclear program. 
Iranian state media reported that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke"" together during the two-hour meeting, which suggests Tehran viewed the discussions positively given their initial refusal to hold ""direct"" talks.
The White House similarly described the talks as ""very positive and constructive,"" though it also conceded that ""very complicated"" issues remain unresolved.

Trump has said negotiations with Iran need to happen ""very quickly"" but he has not provided a specific timeline on how long he will allow the diplomatic process to be carried out before he turns to military options.
The president has repeatedly threatened to ""bomb"" Iran should it not stop its ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon. 
But the extent that the U.S. intends to shut down Tehran’s nuclear program also remains unclear as some call for complete disarmament as Iran also continues to advance its missile programs.

From Dr. Oz’s on-air pseudo-physical to Dr. Harold Bornstein’s claim that he would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” weirdness is the one thing you can count on from a Donald Trump medical report. So it was actually a bit unsettling that the results of the president’s latest physical initially seemed … pretty normal?

President Trump had a physical on Friday, as he announced on Truth Social for unclear reasons.

White House physician Sean Barbabella released the results on Sunday in a three-page summary. Barbabella found the 78-year-old president to be in “excellent” health overall. The report says Trump is taking two medications for cholesterol (Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe), along with aspirin for cardiac prevention, and Mometasone cream “as needed for a skin condition.” Trump had a colonoscopy last summer that revealed diverticulosis and a benign polyp. He’s had cataract surgery, but Barbabella didn’t say when.

Trump’s height is six feet three inches, and his weight is 224 pounds — significantly less than the 239 pounds reported after his 2018 physical, but slightly more than the (highly dubious) 215 pounds listed when he was booked at Fulton County Jail in 2023.

The report goes on to say that Trump got every question right on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (the dementia screening he loves to brag about). And while Trump’s tariffs drama is reportedly affecting Americans’ mental health, the president was within normal range on a screening for anxiety and depression.

“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.” pic.twitter.com/VYXxjPoSEd — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) April 13, 2025

It’s a great health report for a 78-year-old with a passion for fast food and bizarre ideas about how exercise will kill you. But where are the over-the-top declarations about the dear leader’s superior physical and mental toughness?! Finally, Barbabella gives us a tiny shot of Trumpian exaggeration in the final paragraph on page three:

President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function. His active lifestyle continues to contribute significantly to his well-being. President Trump’s days include participating in multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability, and frequent victories in golf events. President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.

So Trump is staying active not just by golfing regularly, but via his “frequent victories in golf events” (which often take place at Trump’s courses and are self-reported). And according to the president’s self-assessment following the exam, in addition to being physically healthy he has a “good heart. A good soul. Very good soul.”

President Trump on his annual physical at Walter Reed: ""I think I did well... I felt I was in very good shape — good heart, a good soul... I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test, & I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right."" pic.twitter.com/5ee4AZTUap — Derrick Evans (@DerrickEvans4WV) April 12, 2025

So ultimately, this latest physical was totally normal for Trump, which is to say kind of weird for anyone else. Nothing to see here! You can go back to stressing about your 401(k).",Left

Consumer advocacy campaigns are targeting some of the largest U.S. retailers this April, with coordinated boycotts aimed at companies accused of corporate tax avoidance, price hikes, and rolling back diversity initiatives. 
Led by The People's Union USA, a grassroots group organizing what it calls an ""Economic Blackout Tour,"" the April actions reflect a broader effort to exert financial pressure on corporations in hopes of change.
The economic boycotts, which span multiple weeks and involve well-known consumer brands, are part of an ongoing nationwide protest against what organizers describe as systemic economic inequality and declining corporate accountability.
The campaign's April targets include General Mills and Walmart, which are facing pressure from critics accusing them of prioritizing profits over workers and communities.
""This is about discipline and awareness,"" The People's Union USA stated on its official website. ""The less we give them, the more power we take back.""
Walmart was the subject of a weeklong boycott from April 7 to April 14. Activists cited rising prices and Walmart's decision to scale back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs as reasons for the action.
The boycott applied to all Walmart operations—including physical stores, online shopping, grocery pickups, and pharmacy services—as well as affiliated brands like Sam's Club, Great Value and Parent's Choice.
General Mills is next on the boycott calendar, with a planned action scheduled from April 21 to April 28.
While specific grievances against the food manufacturing giant have not been shared in boycott statements, it has been listed as part of the Economic Blackout Tour's April campaign.
Consumers are being asked to avoid General Mills brands such as Cheerios and Betty Crocker during the designated window.
From April 18 to 20, The People's Union USA is organizing a larger three-day national economic blackout, urging Americans to withhold all spending at major retailers and online platforms.
Timed to coincide with Easter weekend, the protest builds on earlier actions like the February 28 no-spend day, and aims to spotlight corporate rollbacks of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.
The group is calling for consumers to support local businesses that maintain DEI values while avoiding retail giants such as Walmart, Amazon, and Target during the blackout period.
The effort comes as several major stores—including Costco, Sam's Club, and Macy's—are already set to close on Easter Sunday, aligning in part with the boycott's objectives. Meanwhile, other companies like Walmart and Home Depot are expected to remain open.
The People's Union USA founder John Schwarz previously told Newsweek: ""We're raising awareness not just for our organization, but for the larger truth that most Americans already feel...and that is these corporations do not pay their fair share in taxes. They exploit families, crush small businesses, and continue to profit off inequality and economic control.""
A spokesperson for Walmart previously told Newsweek: ""Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better. As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year...""
""We remain dedicated to earning the business of all Americans and giving our time and resources to causes that uplift and unite communities who rely on us every day.""
Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: ""People are fed up with certain companies profiting off of politics. What do I mean? Walmart, Target and others were some of the loudest on the DEI train while using it as a marketing campaign, just to pull that rug once it was no longer conducive or profitable. I am all for capitalism, but conscious capitalism is the key. This has left a bad taste in many people's mouths, especially Walmart and its' highly subsidized workforce.""
Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: ""Walmart and Amazon... could prove more challenging, as both are seen by many Americans as the sole source of obtaining certain household and grocery items. Still, the fact companies are responding to these proposed boycotts in advance and explaining the positive efforts they've made socially and politically does give credence to the idea they are concerned these could take a bite out of their business, even if it ends up being a small one.""
The April actions are part of a rolling campaign that will continue into the summer, with upcoming boycotts of Amazon, Target and McDonald's.
Still, some finance experts doubt the boycotts will make any long lasting impact.
""I think it will have a minimal impact due to the fact Walmart may be the only store in some of these towns,"" Thompson said. ""Walmart has all but destroyed the small grocery chains around the country and with continued industry consolidation, you may continue to see less competition. The numbers may take a dip, but I see it as a one-time dip if any.""
Organizers have pledged to continue mobilizing until at least July 4 and are encouraging consumers to shift spending to small, local businesses during blackout periods.",Center

""The Supreme Court ruled precedent that if El Salvador wanted to return him,"" she continued. ""This is international matters, foreign affairs.""
Bondi said that ""if they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it – meaning to provide a plane,"" Bondi said.
The Supreme Court ruled last week that a lower court's order ""requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""
Bukele received a warm welcome from Trump, who praised the Salvadorian leader as a ""fantastic"" president who is ""taking care of a lot of problems,"" including accepting hundreds of U.S. migrants into their detention facility, part of a roughly $6 million deal struck by U.S. officials and El Salvador earlier this year. 
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller doubled down on Bondi's assertion, noting that Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian national.

""It's very arrogant, even for American media, to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point,"" Miller told reporters, claiming that ""two courts"" had found Abrego Garcia to be a member of the MS-13 gang.
In fact, Abrego Garcia was granted temporary protection status in the U.S. by a court in 2019 from being removed to El Salvador, after it determined he would face criminal prosecution from gangs if he were removed to his home country.
Bukele, for his part, did not seem to think he had the authority to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., suggesting Monday that the move would be beyond the scope of his authorities.
""How can I smuggle a terrorist into the U.S.? I don't have the power to return him to the United States,"" Bukele said.
FEDERAL JUDGE HAMMERS DOJ ON WHEREABOUTS OF ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBER FOLLOWING SCOTUS ORDER

Also in attendance at Monday's meeting were several members of Trump's Cabinet, including the aforementioned Bondi, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and an architect of Trump's immigration policies. 
The meeting comes as El Salvador has received hundreds of migrants from the U.S., including more than 200 Venezuelan nationals abruptly removed in March under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, and alleged members of the Salvadorian gang MS-13.
Most recently, U.S. officials said they deported 10 more migrants to El Salvador over the weekend. 
As of this writing, the Trump administration has not returned any of the individuals who have been sent to El Salvador's sprawling, high-security prison, including any Venezuelan nationals who may have been mistakenly identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, and one Maryland resident whom U.S. officials acknowledged was wrongfully deported.
In March, after the first migrant flights arrived in El Salvador despite a federal judge's order that the flights be ""immediately"" returned to U.S. soil, Bukele took to social media to mockingly share footage of their arrival.
""Oopsie...Too late,"" he said on X, using an irreverent tone slightly emblematic of Trump's own style.

El Salvador has already accepted hundreds of migrants from the U.S., drawing praise from President Trump and other hard-line immigration hawks – but critics warn the removals may violate due process protections under the U.S. Constitution. Immigration advocates have also raised concerns that deported individuals have not had a chance to challenge their removals in court. 
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said on Monday that he has requested a meeting with Bukele this week to discuss the return of Abrego Garcia. He said in a letter Monday that he has met with Abrego Garcia's family members, including his wife and brother, who expressed to him that they are ""extremely concerned"" about his safety. 
""If Kilmar is not home by midweek – I plan to travel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release,"" Van Hollen said.
Most recently, a federal judge ordered Trump officials last week to provide the court with daily updates about its efforts to ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia, the wrongfully deported Maryland resident.
In a court filing submitted Sunday evening, Justice Department lawyers argued they are not required to comply with a judge's order to ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvadorian prison in what administration officials have since acknowledged was an ""administrative error.""
They argued that the order itself likely exceeds the power of the courts, arguing they ""have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.""
Meanwhile, Trump officials continue to publicly rail against so-called ""activist judges,"" whom they have argued are attempting to stymie Trump's agenda and his priorities on immigration enforcement.  
Noem on Monday praised the Supreme Court's recent emergency ruling that upholds, for now, the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to more quickly deport certain migrants.

The Supreme Court's ruling ""was a very clear message to other judges across this country … [to] stop acting like you have the authority to dictate foreign policy and national security decisions that the president is making to protect its citizens,"" she said in an interview on ""Fox & Friends.""
""We need to stop this, stop allowing liberal judges to try to dictate what President Trump is doing to make America safe again,"" she said. ""I'm grateful for the Supreme Court's decision, and I'm hopeful that we can have a new path forward where the president and his powers are recognized.""

Poland’s foreign minister on Monday urged President Donald Trump to take steps to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin’s continued war in Ukraine following another deadly strike that killed 34, including two children, on Palm Sunday.
""I just want to say how appalled I am by the latest spate of Russian attacks on Ukraine,"" Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told reporters ahead of the European Union’s foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
""Ukraine unconditionally agreed to a ceasefire over a month ago,"" Sikorski said. ""The heinous attacks on Kryvyi Rih and Sumy are Russia's mocking answer.""

Russia fired two ballistic missiles into Sumy’s city center Sunday, claiming it targeted a meeting of top Ukrainian military officials. The northeastern city lies about 30 miles from the Russian border. Moscow said 60 troops were killed but provided no evidence, and it remains unclear if any officials were among the 30 dead and 119 injured.
The attack came just over a week after Russia struck Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih, in what was the deadliest strike against children since the war began in an attack near a playground that killed 19 people, including nine children.
""I hope that President Trump and his administration see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill and I hope the right decisions are taken,"" Sikorski told reporters Monday.

The attacks were met with a swift international rebuke from European leaders, with Germany’s chancellor-designate, Friedrich Merz, calling it a ""serious war crime.""
Leaders from Lithuania made similar claims and summoned a Russian diplomat over the incident on Monday.
France’s foreign minister ahead of the top international talks called for tougher sanctions on Russia to ""suffocate"" its economy and stop its war effort.

Trump similarly condemned the attacks as ""terrible"" but said he ""was told they made a mistake."" 
""But I think it's a horrible thing,"" he added.
Russian forces over the last month have dropped 2,800 air bombs on Ukraine, fired more than 1,400 drones – including 62 Shahed drones Sunday night – and levied some 60 other missiles of various types, according to The Associated Press.

FIRST ON FOX: Consumers’ Research, a leading nonprofit dedicated to consumer information, is launching an advertising campaign against one of the top healthcare systems in the United States, accusing it of prioritizing ""woke"" politics over patient care. 
Consumers’ Research is targeting Henry Ford Health in Detroit, Michigan, with a campaign called ""Ford Health Exposed"" that includes a website where the group says it is spotlighting ""how Henry Ford is putting politics over patients by weaving discriminatory practices into everything it does, administering harmful transgender treatments on kids, and prioritizing a radical climate agenda.""
The website points out that the Henry Ford Health website is littered with examples of ""woke"" ideology being promoted, including DEI, which the hospital has said is ""woven into the fabric of everything we do.""
""Diversity always will be the foundation on which Henry Ford Health stands,"" the organization’s website states.

The website also openly promotes its use of ""unconscious bias training"" as well as Employee Resource Groups to promote its ""diversity"" agenda that it says will ""enhance the quality of care and comfort for each person that we serve.""
The healthcare system also promotes what it describes on its website as ""supplier diversity,"" where it prioritizes working with businesses that are at least 51% owned by LGBTQ+ persons or certain minority categories. 
""Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are simply not enough,"" Kimberlydawn Wisdom, senior vice president of community health and equity and chief wellness and diversity officer at Henry Ford Health, said in a 2021 newsletter posted on the provider’s website. 
""Diversity, equity, and inclusion alone can only mitigate the damage of the past. To prevent the mistakes of the past from burdening our communities in the future, our ultimate destination must be justice.""
'WOKEST HOSPITAL IN AMERICA?': TOP HOSPITAL HIT WITH BLISTERING AD EXPOSING 'POLITICAL AGENDA'

Dr. Maureen Connolly, a pediatrician and LGBTQ+ specialist with HFH, wrote an article promoting transgender treatment on kids, which stated, ""Gender-affirming medical therapy and supported social transition in childhood have been shown to correlate with improved psychological functioning for gender-variant children and adolescents.""
Connolly also promoted ""gender exploration"" in another article posted on the HFH website that says, ""If your daughter says she feels like a boy inside, let her cut her hair, call her by a different name and switch up her wardrobe.""
In addition to the agenda promoted on the website, Henry Ford Health is facing accusations of providing gender treatment to children. The hospital has engaged in sex change treatment, surgeries and puberty blocker treatment in recent years, according to a database compiled by Stop The Harm.
Fox News Digital reached out to Henry Ford Health for comment, but the hospital did not respond to the media inquiry. However, the hospital did delete several DEI sections from its website over the last 24 hours that were archived by Fox News Digital.
The ad campaign charges that HFH is ""pushing irreversible sex changes on kids.""
In 2023, the Ruth Ellis Center nominated HFH for the Ludwig Community Benefit Award for ""improving the well-being of their community by delivering integrated healthcare and social services to LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) youth in Detroit.""
""In 2022, Henry Ford providers at Ruth Ellis facilities cared for more than 700 LGBTQ+ patients, including 429 transgender young adults, over the course of more than 6,800 medical visits,"" a press release touting the partnership between the two entities stated. ""The health and wellness centers have been a source of primary care, gender affirming care, comprehensive sexual health services including HIV prevention and treatment, and behavioral health services for dozens of adolescents and young adults.""
HFH has also been involved in promoting a liberal climate agenda that included spending millions of dollars last year, according to its own website, to create and promote the Central Energy Hub as part of a push for net zero emissions.
HFH also partnered with an energy company in 2021, according to a press release on the website.
""Sustainability is an integral part of building strong, healthy communities,"" Bob Riney, Henry Ford Health System’s president of healthcare operations and chief operations officer, said in the release.

""At Henry Ford, health equity is at the foundation of everything we do. It’s an unfortunate fact that low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by poor environmental conditions, which are exacerbated by climate change. By investing in clean, renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure, we aim to address health disparities and the growing impacts of climate change regionwide, especially in our historically marginalized communities.""
The Consumers' Research campaign will also include mobile billboards outside of hospital locations in Detroit and Macomb, a billboard near the state capitol in Lansing, and chalk stencils around the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.

""Henry Ford Health is prioritizing politics over patients,"" Will Hild, Consumers' Research executive director, told Fox News Digital. ""Driven by gender ideology, Henry Ford has continued performing deeply harmful and irreversible sex-change treatments on children and must be stopped,""
""The hospital's deliberate mutilation of confused children's bodies is being done in direct defiance of President Trump's orders to eliminate the vile practice for good. Henry Ford Health has also committed to embedding DEI into every facet of its operation, elevating a radical ideological agenda above its fundamental duty to provide excellent scientific-based care,"" Hild continued. ""Considering how many resources Henry Ford has squandered on needless, extreme woke programs, the hospital has rendered itself almost indistinguishable from an activist group, not only spewing radical left-wing talking points but actively imposing these ideologies onto patients and staff. Rather than change course, Henry Ford Health has chosen to wear its transgressions with pride, a chilling testament to how far it has strayed from its original purpose. Consumers' Research will continue to put these hospitals on blast for putting a woke agenda over patient care.""

The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities — including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.

It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s security or sovereignty.

Here’s what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.

Ban on LGBTQ+ events?

The amendment, the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country’s contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.

That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events — such as Budapest Pride — and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).

Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary’s constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life — including that to peacefully assemble.

The amendment also declares that “a person’s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female” — an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.

This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.

The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.

The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orbán, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.

His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda,” but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.

Citizenship could be suspended

Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán’s government.

The self-described “illiberal” leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary’s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.

In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.”

As part of the government’s sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians’ citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.

Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.

‘This is fascism’

The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orbán later said would be prohibited by new legislation.

Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: “This is not child protection, this is fascism.”

On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orbán’s government of being an “intimidating and cowardly power,” writing on social media: “Let’s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.”

Another protest is expected after the passage of the amendment.",Lean Left

FIRST ON FOX: A Texas-driven campaign to tackle children’s ""abysmal"" literacy rates over recent decades is hoping to go national, as President Donald Trump rolls back DEI initiatives and curbs progressive gender ideology that has taken center stage in recent years.
""Literacy has taken a backseat, and it's because people don't know our kids can't read,"" said Pete Geren, former secretary of the Army and a former Democratic congressman from Texas. ""I make a lot of public presentations. I meet with elected officials, state reps, who you know it's really a state issue. They have no awareness of this.""
At Grade Level, a Texas-based organization behind the ""Have Your Child Read to You"" campaign, is partnering with Geren – a former congressman from the '90s and now president and CEO of the Sid W. Richardson Foundation – who is a well-known advocate for public education.

""The federal government has told us over and over and over that most of our kids cannot read proficiently, and it has never led to a literacy movement in this country,"" Geren said.
Geren and At Grade Level are urging parents to do a simple task: ask their children to read out loud to them to see if they are learning proficiently in school. 
Only 43% of more than 170,000 students are reading at proficient grade level, according to state test scores in Fort Worth, and close to 100% of parents believe their children can read at grade level. The numbers on a national scale show a similar trend.

""It's our goal to build awareness,"" Geren said. ""The missing link in the political movement is the parents… if they know, everything will change. Parents will do anything for their kids, and they'll fix this problem at home and at the governmental level.""
Reading proficiency among eighth graders dropped to 67%, the lowest in 32 years, while only 60% of fourth graders met basic reading standards, according to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
Only 67% of eighth-graders met or exceeded basic reading skills on the 2024 NAEP exam, down 2 percentage points from 1992 when the testing began. The NAEP, often referred to as the Nation’s Report Card, is the gold standard for measuring student academic performance.
And poor literacy rates are closely tied to crime, according to At Grade Level, reporting that approximately 80% of Texas prison inmates are functionally illiterate. 
""We've got the district attorney, we've got the county judge, and so many leaders coming out because of the connection to crime,"" Geren said.

In February, Fort Worth Police Chief Neil Noakes said at a press conference that the statistics ""paint a stark, tragic picture of our present situation, but that doesn’t have to be our future.""
""Many of the people incarcerated right now are there, in part, because of that lack of proper literacy levels that they did not receive when they were young,"" Noakes said.

Trump signed executive orders to eliminate DEI programs and gender ideology instruction in K-12 schools in January. Two months later, he moved to significantly downsize the Department of Education to shift more control over education back to the states.
While downsizing the department, Trump criticized the billions of dollars funneled into the public education system while students’ test scores in core subjects have continued to plummet.
""We want great education. So they rank 40 countries in education, we’re ranked dead last, but the good news is we’re number one in one category. You know what that is? Cost per pupil,"" Trump told Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy at a press conference in February. ""We spend more per pupil than any other country in the world.""
U.S. federal, state and local governments collectively spend about $857.2 billion annually on K-12 public education. Despite a record $190 billion in federal aid since the pandemic, students' academic performance has seen little improvement. An analysis by The New York Times in March found that, since the pandemic, students have fallen behind by more than half a year in math and also struggled in reading and science.

“I believe in the West,” Georgiadis said in an exclusive interview last week in his office here. “The West will not survive without a strong United States. The United States is the natural leader of the West. So, for me as a politician that believes in the West, a strong United States is a strong West. A weak United States is a weak West. I hope he will succeed.”

Georgiadis also said that while tariffs are a “very difficult decision” for all sides, Trump is trying to rebalance the U.S. economy after decades of decline. He said the weaknesses the West faces in its supply chain were exposed during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Tariffs are a very difficult decision, and I’m sure they’re a very difficult decision also for President Trump and for Europe and for everybody,” Georgiadis said. “But I have knowledge that the American deficit was huge. And as the American economy was going, it had a lot of problems. So he had to take some radical decisions. I will give an example. During the pandemic crisis in Europe we realized that in very critical production lines of our industry that all of our production lines were in Asia. I will mention as an example pharmaceuticals. So as part of the pandemic, a big discussion started in the European Union that we have to find our own resources because in a difficult time we did not have a single factory that was producing the critical elements for producing medicines in Europe. The same thing happened with the United States. All big industries after the 80s traveled abroad. So I think that the tariff decision of President Trump is a way to try to rebirth American industry and I can understand that this is a difficult decision but necessary for an American president.”

Georgiadis also told Breitbart News that Trump’s comeback victory in the United States to win back the White House last year was “amazing.” Georgiadis, who is currently the Health Minister of Greece and also the Vice President of the governing New Democracy Party in Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s government here, has served in a number of key roles during Mitsotakis’s administration dating back to 2019.

“First of all I have to say as a politician that this was a unique victory in political history,” Georgiadis said. “The way he came back is something that politicians worldwide will try to study and take lessons from it. Of course he made a very brave campaign in a very difficult environment with most of the media against him, a lot of polls that weren’t really very accurate, and at the end he managed to take a very big victory. It’s amazing, I’m saying as a politician to a politician. I try never to interfere in the internal politics of our allies especially the United States but of course I would be a Republican. Everybody knows this is where I stand. So we believe that as in his first term, Greece and the United States have an excellent relationship. You know big strategic partnerships between Greece and the United States started during President Trump’s first term in the White House. I had the honor as Minister of Finance and Development to sign a very important deal at that time with then-Secretary Pompeo. We managed to attract a lot of U.S. investments in Greece after that agreement. We believe in his second term, we will have an even better relationship because Greece and the United States were always allies, were always friends, and we’re anxious to do things with President Trump and his government.”

Greece has two vice presidents helping lead its governing party, New Democracy. The other, Kostis Hatzidakis, is the deputy prime minister.

Asked during his interview with Breitbart News at the Greek Health Ministry offices last week if he had a specific message for President Trump back in the Untied States, Georgiadis said while Mitsotakis will provide the government’s official message to the United States he personally believes the United States is the leader of the West and that he is rooting for Trump.

“The message will come from Prime Minister Mitsotakis—he always gives the message for our country.” Georgiadis said. “On a personal basis, I want to tell to Mr. Trump that we perceive the United States as the leader of the West. We trust the United States for this leadership.”

Mitsotakis of course sat with Breitbart News in Athens in his office at Maximos Mansion and said he believes the United States and European Union would be able to reach a trade deal soon. Mitsotakis’s interview has dominated Greek and international press since Breitbart News published it, because Trump himself responded to it at the White House praising Mitsotakis and saying he agrees that a deal can be reached. In the aftermath of the interview, Trump paused the new tariffs on all nations except China for 90 days and the European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen has echoed Mitsotakis’s commentary saying she too believes a new trade agreement can be reached with Trump.

Georgiadis echoed this sentiment in his comments to Breitbart News, saying he is sure that the two sides can reach a deal.

“I’m totally sure that Greece as a country and our prime minister will do their best to find a way out for the best and most reasonable partnership for the European Union and the United States of America,” Georgiadis said. “The European Union and the United States of America are natural allies. The West is the European Union and the United States of America so beyond the agreements, good partners can sometimes have disagreements, at the end we are going to reach a good deal for both parties. I’m totally confident of that and I’m confident in President Trump that in the end he will reach this deal.”

Georgiadis, in his interview with Breitbart News, said he believes that the United States and Greece can deepen already strong economic ties during Trump’s second term in the White House.

“There is a big space of common investment between Greece and the United States and a potential for a lot more of that,” Georgiadis said. “There is a lot with Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Google, and others in the tech industry. But I think there is a lot of potential also in the defense industry like shipyards. We have already a big American investment in Greek shipyards through ONEX. I’m telling you again, in this transforming world, finding ways to build strong ties between the key countries of the West is very important. The United States is the leader of the West, but Greece is a big symbol of the West in a very sensitive region. It is a symbol because democracy was born here, and the key elements of the West were born here. But at the same time we are the strategic ally of the United States in the eastern Mediterranean. At this time, the eastern Mediterranean is a very sensitive part of the world because of what’s happening to the Middle East, what’s happening to Ukraine, what’s happening in northern Africa. Greece now is a key role-player in this area and President Trump has to know we are a reliable partner for the United States of America.”

Georgiadis described the IMEEC Corridor—which stands for India-Middle East-Europe-Economic-Corridor—as a Western-led answer to the Chinese Community Party’s Belt and Road Initiative. The deal strings together India through the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, into Cyprus then Greece then western Europe before heading on to the United States.

“We have to have an answer because you see China build in it a very serious way their own corridors in recent years,” Georgiadis said. “In some ways, the West was left behind. We have to find answers and we have to find the answer as fast as possible.”

One of the key planks for IMEEC’s success is Saudi Arabia-Israel relations. Saudi Arabia has not yet joined the Abraham Accords, and Georgiadis told Breitbart News that Mitsotakis has worked to build ties with the Saudi government to help accomplish this broader economic connectivity.

“The Mitsotakis government, and the prime minister himself throughout his first term through now, have built a very strong relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” Georgiadis said. “The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the key country along this corridor that will bring commerce from India to Europe and from Europe to North America in a very fast manner. Yes, this is something we have to build as fast as possible.”

Georgiadis also said he believes that the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in Israel was motivated by an effort to derail Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords.

“I really believe that the terrorist attack Hamas did on October 7 of 2023, one of the biggest targets was to sabotage the Abraham agreement,” Georgiadis said. “We in Greece support Israel 100 percent. Israel is our strategic partner in this area. The safety of Israel is the safety of Greece. The safety of Israel will be much stronger after these agreements. It’s very important for us all to work together to see these agreements become a reality and having a real good relationship between Israel, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the other Arab countries that want to have an agreement and be part of this deal. I think this is all very important and we support them 100 percent in Greece. I support them very strongly.”

All that being said, Georgiadis said he is confident the Saudis will return to the table eventually with the Israelis.

“I’m totally sure they will come back,” Georgiadis said. “The leadership of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also a very and efficient leadership. The Crown Prince is a leader with a big vision for his country. The 2030 vision is a unique vision. That shows a leader that really understands the interests of his country and the region. I trust that he will find a way to make this agreement go forward.”",Right

President Donald Trump’s back-and-forth tariff changes dominated the news cycle over the weekend.

Late on Sunday night, Trump told reporters that semiconductor tariffs will “take place in the very near future,” but expressed some “flexibility” regarding tariffs on products such as iPhones and tablets, adding more uncertainty to an already high-paced rollout of tariffs on Chinese goods.

Tech exemption temporary: Trump’s comments are likely to dampen the optimism for tech companies and investors sparked by a tariff exemption for key electronics that was noted by US Customs and Border Protection on Friday.

Many of those items come from China, with which the White House is engaged in an escalating trade war.

Trump’s comments echoed those of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the exemptions were only a temporary reprieve and that those products would face separate levies.

Trump also emphasized that no one was “getting off the hook” in his trade war.

The market reacts: Global stock markets rose on Monday following the temporary exemption.

Criticism and concern: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump’s “red light-green light” approach to tariffs. “Nobody can figure out what the rules will be five days from now, much less five years from now,” Warren said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” that the tariff policy is “the worst self-inflicted wound through economic policy” since World War II.

And billionaire investor Ray Dalio told NBC’s “Meet the Press” the US is “very close to a recession.” Dalio called Trump’s trade policies “very disruptive” so far, though he acknowledged it “could be part of a process.”",Left

Ed Martin, Trump's pick who is serving as DC's interim top prosecutor, has dismissed Capitol riot cases and fired prosecutors involved.

The letter claims Martin was abusing the power of the Justice Department by describing himself and colleagues as ""Trump's lawyers.""

Martin allegedly represented January 6 defendants while simultaneously serving as interim US attorney, violating legal ethics rules.

Senate Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff of California, are working to block Martin's confirmation.

CNN —

Five former prosecutors who worked on criminal cases stemming from the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are urging the disciplinary office governing lawyers in Washington, DC, to open an investigation into President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to be the district’s top prosecutor.

The filing is the latest turn in the nomination of Ed Martin to be US attorney for DC and comes as Senate Democrats have pledged to delay any confirmation vote.

Martin, who has been serving in the post on an interim basis since Trump returned to the White House, is a divisive pick for the job. After stepping into the position, he used his new powers to dismiss January 6 Capitol riot cases, fire prosecutors who were involved in the investigations, go after his and Trump’s political adversaries, and launch internal reviews in an attempt to find misconduct within the office.

In a letter filed Sunday with the DC Bar’s Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the former prosecutors outlined those controversial actions, as well as others, saying that Martin violated several professional rules.

“He has used his brief time in office to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of a federal prosecutor, announcing investigations against his political opponents, aiding defendants he previously represented, and communicating improperly with those he did not,” the group wrote.

“These actions are not worthy of the Department of Justice, undermine the Constitutional guarantee of equal protection of law, and violate Mr. Martin’s professional obligations,” the letter reads.

Martin’s office declined CNN’s request for comment on the letter.

In addition to the five former prosecutors, the letter was also signed by prominent conservative lawyers from the Society for the Rule of Law, including retired federal Judge J. Michael Luttig, former Rep. Barbara Comstock, attorney George Conway, and Stuart Gerson, a lawyer who held top roles at the Justice Department under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

The letter pointed to a statement from Martin on the DC US attorney’s X account earlier this year in which he described himself and his colleagues as “Trump’s lawyers” to argue that he was abusing the power of the Justice Department. The letter said the social media post reinforced Martin’s public statements suggesting he was pursuing investigations into “perceived political enemies of himself and the President.”

“Mr. Martin’s client is not President Trump; it is the United States,” the letter states. “His assertion otherwise adds further evidence that his announced investigations are politically motivated.”

Last month, Martin also announced that he was forming a “special unit” to “protect elections.” The group, he said in an internal email announcing it, “will continue to make sure that all the election laws of our nation are obeyed.”

“Nearly 20 years later, Americans do not have confidence in our election systems,” he wrote. “One of the best ways to restore that confidence is to protect our systems and demand accountability.”

And he launched a probe into prosecutors who brought obstruction charges under US Code 1512(c) against some rioters that were ultimately tossed because of a Supreme Court decision last summer.

Representing January 6 defendants

The letter also details Martin’s representation of defendants who were prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department for their involvement in the Capitol attack. In one case, the letter says, Martin was still repping the individual even after being tapped to serve as interim US attorney. He didn’t withdraw his representation of the man until after the case was dismissed by a federal judge in DC.

“By acting simultaneously as a prosecutor and defense attorney in the same case, Mr. Martin violated Rule 1.7(a), which directs that ‘A lawyer shall not advance two or more adverse positions in the same matter,’” the letter reads.

“Collectively, Mr. Martin’s actions threaten to undermine the integrity of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the legal profession in the District of Columbia,” the group told the disciplinary board. “The reputation of our community depends on a prompt and thorough investigation into Mr. Martin’s violations of his professional obligations.”

‘This man is unqualified’

Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill have ratcheted up their efforts to block Martin’s confirmation.

Sen. Adam Schiff of California recently announced that he was placing a hold on Martin’s nomination.

“I hope the Republicans do their job. This man is unqualified, he’s abused the powers of that office. He’s made the strongest case you can make to be rejected for this position,” Schiff, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN.

“This is a ‘Stop the Steal’ lawyer, who has embraced the worst antisemites and who has the most profound conflicts of interest, dismissing cases against people that he still represents. If he is not disqualified then it shows Republicans are willing to accept any Trump nominee, no matter how inappropriate for the job,” the senator said.

CNN’s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.

President Trump may have paused his tariffs against American allies last week, but he only escalated hostilities against China, raising tariffs on imports from the country to 145 percent. Given America’s dependence on Chinese goods, such restrictions will hurt conglomerates and small businesses alike. And tensions between the rival superpowers aren’t likely to die down soon. Over the weekend, Trump’s bumbling commerce secretary Howard Lutnick signaled that the new exemptions Trump had made on electronics might not last long, while China, which had already leveled 125 percent tariffs on American goods, announced that it would suspend the importation of some rare minerals, which could seriously hinder U.S. car manufacturers and defense contractors, among others.

The Trump team’s strategy, to the extent there is one, has been marked by impulsiveness. But what is China thinking? To shed some light on that question, I spoke with Dan Wang, a research fellow at the Hoover History Lab at Stanford University, who has frequently written about China’s politics and trade policy.

With this trade war, there’s the political side and there’s the financial side. And on the political side, Trump is acting like he holds all the cards with China. He wants Xi to set up a phone call with him, and Xi does not seem interested in doing that. Both of these two leaders hate seeming weak, but Trump has a long history of folding, and Xi does not. He’s known for being steadfast. So do you think there’s any incentive for Xi to blink first, or does it make more sense from his standpoint to wait out this standoff as long as it goes?

﻿I lived in Beijing during the first trade war, all the way through the signing of the phase-one trade deal. And my sense of the Chinese leadership side is that they do not enjoy negotiating with Trump, who is remarkably erratic, often unclear with demands, and also escalates a great deal. That is just an aesthetically displeasing experience for Xi.

On the other hand, America has tremendous amounts of economic buying power, and China’s economy, which is fairly export-dependent, and manufactures a lot of goods for exports, certainly wouldn’t like it if roughly 145 percent tariffs exist on goods to one of its major export markets forever. So there is certainly some incentive to reduce the pain for a lot of Chinese companies to preserve some trading relationship, and to keep economic growth going when China’s economy hasn’t fully recovered from the COVID years.

I was struck by a quote I saw in the Times — a political scientist said the trade war “will actually save Xi Jinping from having to take responsibility for the lack of economic growth in China. It is a ‘get out of jail free’ card for him.” Do you agree with that?

﻿Somewhat, but I don’t think it’s such a total “get out of jail free” card, because Chinese who have spent much of the last five years facing really uncertain economic outlooks know that the economy wasn’t doing all that well before Trump’s tariffs. I also lived through the entirety of the “zero-COVID” experience in China, when a lot of service sectors faced completely unpredictable shutdowns. During the peak of China’s success in zero-COVID, it felt like Beijing had the virus under control when the rest of the world did not. In 2021, the politburo announced a “structural reform.” That is when it smashed a lot of internet platforms and announced major restrictions on property development — that’s also one of the main things that has made China’s economy really weak, which is a significant slowdown in property purchases as well as construction.

So I think yes, to some extent Trump’s tariffs will cause a nationalistic rallying around the flag in China, because the politburo will pretty easily be able to portray China as being significantly bullied. On the other hand, I think people are very well aware that the economy has been fairly weak over the last five years.

Though that may also mean that China is more used to these circumstances and is less likely to be shocked by them.

﻿You could say that Xi has been preparing China for tremendous economic stresses since the start of his leadership in 2012. It really accelerated through the course of the first trade war. This is where you also see some more extreme language from Xi. During zero-COVID times, Xi said that China needs to prepare for “extreme” scenarios. The Communist Party typically speaks obliquely about such matters, but we can wonder what he meant. One possible, I think quite valid, interpretation is for the severing of total economic relations in the event that Beijing launches some sort of conflict against Taiwan.

And you can certainly read tremendous economic tariffs as a part of the extreme scenarios that Xi has been preparing for. He has been trying to harden the Chinese economy over the last ten years to reduce its dependencies on a lot of western products so that China is much more self-sufficient in terms of technology, manufactured goods, food, and energy. In a way, you could say that Xi has been preparing for severing economic ties with the U.S. and the rest of the West for longer than Trump has been preparing for this.

In your experience living there, do you think the populace goes for that kind of messaging? That they need to sacrifice possibly their own economic well-being for the greater good of China? It’s sort of similar to what some of the MAGA base is preaching now — short-term pain for supposed long-term gain.

﻿I think MAGA’s message is short-term pain for long-term gain. And I think Beijing’s message is short-term pain and long-term pain. Over the last few days, the spokespeople from Beijing’s Foreign Ministry have posted clips of Mao saying, “So long as the Americans want to fight on in Korea, we will match them.” The Korean War is the only conflict in which Chinese troops faced off against American troops directly on the battlefield. And so this is something that they’re trotting out, that the Korean War had hundreds of thousands of losses for China right after they suffered hundreds of thousands of losses from the Japanese invasion, as well as China’s own civil war.

I think there is this sense that Chinese are really capable of suffering. They have done that during wartime, during the Great Leap Forward, during the Cultural Revolution. The future is going to be glorious, but there is going to be a lot of pain ahead. And I wonder to what extent Americans are prepared for this sort of message. The U.S. and China have a lot of trade between them, but Americans are also very much dependent on Chinese goods, Chinese production, and Chinese manufacturers in all sorts of ways.

The U.S. isn’t known for its self-sacrificing nature, but Trump voters trust him to the extent that they might go along with him for a while.

It is also a little unclear to what extent Trump voters are able to suffer economic pain. During the first trade war, prices didn’t rise all that much and didn’t contribute all that much inflation. Tariffs now are much, much higher than before, and inflation is still stuck at the higher end. During the first trade war, Beijing was pretty sophisticated about targeting exporters, congressional district by congressional district, essentially to try to make Trump lose the 2018 midterm elections. And there are certainly goods that China has a lot of leverage over. Almost the entirety of U.S. sorghum exports goes to China. The vast majority of U.S. soybean exports go to China.

And by cutting off these markets, it can deal tremendous, concentrated pain to American farmers who are a big part of Trump’s voting base. A lot of Chinese will be pretty upset about the loss of their manufacturing activity as well as higher prices on their own goods, in many cases, because of China’s own retaliation. But I think Beijing’s bet is that its populace can endure these sorts of problems much better than voters in America can.

Going back to what you said about Taiwan, which has been a preoccupation of Xi for years — do you think that this trade chaos and further separation from the West will just make him more aggressive with the already aggressive territorial moves he’s making?

﻿I think the tariffs certainly make the situation more dangerous, because I don’t think Beijing launching military action or blockading Taiwan is imminent. I don’t think there’s any timeline involved, because in part there are pretty significant deterrents for Xi to launch military or blockade action. One of them is that Xi would have to accept a severing of a lot of economic ties, perhaps even most economic and financial ties with the West — as we saw in the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But if the tariffs are maintained for long, this feels like the West throwing away one of the great deterrents against Beijing’s action. During peacetime, what we could be seeing is economic decoupling, such that it’s less of a deterrent for Xi to launch military action.

That doesn’t mean there’s no deterrent against military action. It is possible that the People’s Liberation Army will lose, because Taiwan is a really difficult spot to invade. And it is apparently the case that Xi doesn’t fully trust the People’s Liberation Army to be the fighting-competent force that he needs it to be since it hasn’t fought a war in nearly 50 years now. And the Financial Times reported that Xi has purged the second-highest-ranking military officer of the People’s Liberation Army, who has a seat on the politburo. That is a very, very high-ranking military official. If that’s true, it’s another signal that Xi doesn’t quite have complete confidence in his armed forces.

In the case of Russia, there was almost a complete cessation of economic activity with the West. Yet Russia has managed to survive, in large part because China was an economic lifeline. But if China was cut off, what would be its lifeline?

﻿Well, China is a very, very big country. One of the things central planners in Beijing like to brag about is that it has, in its terms, a relatively complete industrial chain, which is to say that it is able to manufacture pretty much anything aside from a few categories of highest-end semiconductors and jet engines. But I think it is certainly the case that China has extremely sophisticated and capacious manufacturing capacities. And that was something that was also made pretty apparent during zero-COVID, when China was able to scale up production of masks, cotton swabs, and other basic medical equipment extremely quickly in a way the U.S. wasn’t really able to get its act together on.

The value of China’s exports to the U.S. is about 2 percent of GDP. And between a lot of rerouting and smuggling, I don’t think there will be a complete cessation of Chinese exports. So it is a problem, but it is not, in the Chinese media’s terms, the sky falling over on us.

Another point about China’s economy right now: One of the criticisms of China is that it hasn’t stimulated enough after the property bust, or firmed up consumer spending. And there is plenty of room. There are constraints around the extent to which China’s government could save its own economy, but I think this is pretty real and pretty valid. There is scope for China to do more, and now it really must do more, because its exports are under quite a lot of pressure.

And that also includes giving people better pensions, better health care, better social spending generally, right?

﻿Yes. Xi has been saying for the last couple of months, and arguably the last couple of years, that China needs to be more of a consumer-oriented economy, and these tariffs are giving Beijing the kick in the pants it needs really to be much more serious about promoting domestic consumption.

I think some western economists have been a little confused as to why they haven’t done that before. So if this trade war pushes them into doing it, could it supercharge the economy and actually turn out quite well in some sense?

﻿It could. Supercharge is a strong term, perhaps.

Charge.

﻿Charge, yes. Tepidly charge.

In the near term, could China and Europe become closer as the U.S. drifts away? The consensus seems to be probably not, because there are too many barriers between them.

﻿Well, closer is a term of art. Donald Trump and J.D. Vance have done their very best to insult Europeans as much as they can. And the Europeans don’t love that they are being tariffed over nonsense measures. It was probably an accident of timing that the Spanish prime minister was visiting Beijing last week, but it is not an accident that a lot of European leaders will be visiting Beijing in July, which is something that they’ve announced.

So I can see how many countries will really have to weigh — do they try to access the American market, which is of course the world’s biggest consumer market, and the best trading partner for a lot of countries? And then China offers a slower-moving sort of aggression and far less erraticness than Donald Trump does. I think it is not a very simple thing to say that all countries will either completely choose China or completely choose the U.S. I think it is going to throw a lot of them into a lot of doubt, and maybe make them just reject both countries.

The primary challengers stepping up against veteran Democrats in recent months are emphasizing young-voter issues and railing against the ways they feel the Democratic Party has failed — from how it’s pushed back on President Donald Trump’s early actions to addressing the rising cost of living.

Saikat Chakrabarti, a 39-year-old former chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, launched a bid in early February for Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s House seat in California. Last month, 26-year-old social media star Kat Abughazaleh jumped into the race for veteran Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky’s seat. Since then, a handful of other new faces have entered the midterm arena against entrenched incumbents, with Jake Rakov, 37, challenging his old boss, Rep. Brad Sherman, in California and George Hornedo, 34, launching a challenge against nine-term Rep. Andre Carson in Indiana’s 7th District.

The local calls for change come as the party reached an all-time low in popularity in the most recent national NBC News poll, with almost two-thirds of Democrats saying they want congressional Democrats to fight rather than compromise, even at the risk of not getting things done.

Young Democratic voters interviewed by NBC News echoed these views, saying they’re “disappointed” by a lack of action from Democrats. Some said they see the party’s messaging as “redundant” and think party leaders aren’t representing the issues affecting younger generations, with the rising cost of living getting frequent mention.

“They’re not listening to what their voters want, and it’s just backfiring on them,” said Sean Connor, a college student from Charlotte, North Carolina.

Connor said he sees a lack of “real leadership” from Democrats but noted efforts from Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders to rally anti-Trump crowds as successful in mobilizing voters.

“Besides AOC, there’s not a lot of young people in Congress to feel represented,” Connor said. “I feel like the people controlling my life and controlling our government, they’re decades behind what we really need.”

Darcy McMillan, a 25-year-old nursing student from Raleigh, North Carolina, said her ideal candidate would be someone younger who understands “what normal people are going through,” which she said is a divergence from the representatives she’s seen in Congress.

“A lot of them are so out of touch, or 80 years old,” said McMillan. “So someone who’s younger, empathetic, has lived lives similar enough to us that they get it. Because I don’t feel like I can relate to a lot of representatives.”

“They keep saying, ‘We hear you, we see you,’” said Rebecca, a 24-year-old voter from East Brunswick, New Jersey, who declined to share her last name. “But I haven’t seen them condemn what Trump is doing, and the fact that his policies are making it more expensive to live in the United States. I haven’t seen anyone say, ‘This is what we’re planning to do or bring up instead.’”

From California to Illinois, the batch of young Democratic candidates running primary challenges are focusing their criticism on where they think Democrats have “abandoned” voters or “blocked change,” often pointing to congressional seniority — an asset in the Capitol, where it comes with better committee assignments and more clout — as a weakness when it comes to representing the current issues facing their districts.

“You’ll see people like Sen. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Sherman have been there for decades, who are still operating at the speed of 1996,” said Rakov, who is running to represent California’s 32nd District, encompassing Malibu and the Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Rakov, who was a staffer for Sherman in 2017, said after Trump took office in January, he saw Sherman making TV appearances using similar messaging and “doing the exact same thing” as he did in Trump’s first term. He said that’s when he knew he had to run.

“I was like, ‘This is exactly what’s wrong with the Democratic Party,’” Rakov said. “If we keep going down this road, it’s gotten us Trump twice. I don’t want to think about what it’s going to get us next time if we don’t change route.”

Rakov said Democrats are currently “flat-footed” in their approach to voters and are failing to match the energy and anger from their base as constituents are negatively impacted by the Trump administration. He said he thinks Democrats have gotten “stuck in their talking points” instead of having candid conversations with constituents about the issues affecting them, and he charged Sherman with being absent from his district in recent months.

Rakov said his challenge to Sherman isn’t based on ideological or even generational differences.

“There’s nothing about an age,” Rakov said. “This isn’t a generational argument, but this is about needing to actually get new energy and new voices into Congress on a regular basis. Congress was never meant to be a career.”

In a statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for Sherman’s campaign committee pointed to the numerous challengers he’s faced through the years, saying Rakov was the first who “has never voted in Sherman’s district prior to announcing his candidacy.”

“Rakov has not identified any single one of Congressman Sherman’s thousands of votes that he disagrees with,” the statement said. “So at least there is an important aspect of the job that he believes Sherman has performed flawlessly.”

Rakov pushed back against the statement, saying he’s lived and voted in Los Angeles for “many years” of his life, having moved with his husband to the 32nd District earlier this year. And he said in an email that Sherman's ""own social media"" hasn't shown him ""here since February — even through Congress had an 11 day recess last month.""

Abughazaleh, who is running to represent Illinois’ 9th District, said she “got sick of waiting around and for someone to do what I thought should happen.”

Born to a Palestinian immigrant father and raised by Republican parents, Abughazaleh built a following through rapid-response videos for Media Matters and other organizations, arguing against right-wing narratives to hundreds of thousands of online followers.

“I think a lot of people assume this is going to be a purely digital campaign,” said Abughazaleh, who noted she’s currently the only person managing her social media. “But it’s actually the opposite. We want to build a deeply on-the-ground campaign focused on mutual aid, direct action, and meeting people where they are.”

She’s launching her campaign in a district she didn’t grow up in, hasn’t voted in and only moved to last year — which has already become a point of contention for some Democrats opposed to her candidacy.

Abughazaleh pushes back on that framing, saying, “I would say I have the same right to run as everyone else. This is a district that’s a quarter foreign-born. It has multiple colleges, tons of people from out of state. … I did not expect to, but I moved here last year — and I really love living here.”

Schakowsky — an 80-year-old progressive stalwart who has represented the district since 1999, before Abughazaleh was born — hasn’t yet announced whether she’ll run again but said in a statement to NBC News that she has “always encouraged more participation in the democratic process.”

“I’ll be deciding on my plans soon,” Schakowsky added, “but if I do indeed decide to retire, there are dozens of talented leaders, advocates, and organizers in the 9th Congressional District who know our community and who are ready to lead the charge as we fight back against the extreme MAGA regime and Trump’s shameful policies.”

Abughazaleh maintains she isn’t launching a campaign against Schakowsky — at least not yet. She called Schakowsky “historically one of the most progressive members of Congress,” but added “a lot of us … are worried about older people staying in office for longer periods of time.”

Asked if Schakowsky’s age played a role in her decision, Abughazaleh said, “I mean, it didn’t not.”",Lean Left

Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he will not make ""big concessions"" to President Donald Trump in order to get a trade deal wrapped up ahead of talks due to start on April 17 in Washington, but also said on Monday that he would not be imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports.
Ishiba told parliament that Japan needs to understand Trump's views on tariffs and trade ""in terms of the logic and the emotional elements"" behind them, Reuters reported.
Trump is using tariffs to protect domestic businesses from what he sees as unfair global competition, or to win them greater access to international markets.
Japan is one of the largest trading partners of the U.S. The outcomes of these talks could alter American access to Japan's lucrative auto and electronics markets, and potentially affect agricultural exports, too.
The relationship is further complicated by national security considerations as the U.S. shifts its strategic focus to China and the Pacific, where Japan is a key ally of Washington.
Trump has imposed a universal baseline 10-percent tariff on foreign imports. He has, however, paused for 90 days an additional ""reciprocal"" rate on U.S. trading partners to give time for trade negotiations, such as those about to take place with Japan.
Separately, Trump imposed a 25-percent tariff on foreign steel, aluminum, and autos, which remains in place.
Goods trade with Japan was worth $227.9 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).
U.S. goods exports to Japan in 2024 were $79.7 billion, with trade the other way worth $148.2 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $68.5 billion for the U.S.
Trump points to America's trade deficits as evidence of an imbalanced and unfair relationship, and is using tariffs to force negotiations on new terms.
Japan's trade profile with the U.S. is concentrated in exports of automobiles and high-tech electronics, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
Top U.S. exports to Japan include liquefied natural gas, pharmaceutical preparations, meat and poultry, industrial machines, medicines and medical equipment, civilian aircraft, engines and parts, and corn.
Japan maintains relatively lower tariffs overall, but protects sectors like agriculture and leather goods through non-tariff barriers and quotas identified in the USTR's 2024 National Trade Estimate report.
In March, Trump spoke critically of a long-standing security treaty that obliges the U.S. to defend Japan if it comes under attack, in exchange for allowing American bases on Japanese soil. Tokyo must also defend the U.S. if it is attacked in a Japanese territory.
While Ishiba has not proposed altering the pact, tensions around tariffs and strategic partnerships remain intertwined.
Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday: ""I'm not of the view that we should make big concessions for the sake of wrapping up negotiations quickly…In negotiating with the United States, we need to understand what's behind Trump's argument both in terms of the logic and the emotional elements behind his views.""
Riley Walters, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute research organization, wrote in March: ""U.S.-Japan negotiations will be an interesting case study. In some ways, other governments can learn how to negotiate with the Trump administration on trade and economic matters.
""But the relationship between the U.S. and Japan is also unique. Most countries do not share the same level of economic, security, or political relations that exist between the U.S. and Japan.""

“Pr… [+4848 chars]","Americans must be hit by “surround-sound” PR to help reverse the public’s rejection of migration, says a co-executive director of a lobby group funded by billionaire heiress Laurene Powell Jobs.

“Pro-immigrant messaging must be strategic, relentless, and funded to scale at the speed of modern media consumption,” director Beatriz Lopez wrote in an April 9 article.

The goal is to manufacture an apparent public “consensus” for more migration, according to Lopez:

coordinated [PR] content creates a sense of consensus — giving people a familiar framework to fall back on when forming opinions. Repetition isn’t noise; it’s how narratives take hold. … A well-informed public that sees immigrants as neighbors, workers, and contributors is essential for democracy itself. A public misled by fear will support mass deportations, surveillance, and state-sponsored cruelty — especially when they’re presented as the only available options. … Pro-immigrant forces will succeed if they offer an alternative vision of a modern immigration system centered on citizenship and safety that empowers working families and fuels democracy.

The article promoted a free video where a veteran criticized Trump’s pro-American policy, saying, “his immigration polices are immoral … it goes against all the values that I learned in the military.”

“The real issue isn’t policy; it’s communication,” Lopez said in a March 6 post against national solidarity.”It’s time to go on offense, flood the zone, and make the case for a country that works for all of us.”

In reality, the federal government uses a ruthless economic policy of Extraction Migration to grow Wall Street — and Powell Jobs’ stock wealth — by importing more consumers, renters, and workers from developing countries, regardless of the massive pocketbook and civic damage to ordinary Americans and the migrants’ own countries.

For example, under President Joe Biden’s high-migration policies, 300 million blue-collar and white-collar Americans lost wealth in the labor and housing markets, and the workplace investment, productivity, and training once enabled by employers.

Many college graduates also lost career opportunities as his deputies expanded the inflow of white-collar workers, such as H-1B visa workers.

FLASHBACK: 1,500 Migrants Surge Across Border into Texas in Six Hours

Citizens also lost civic stability to government-imposed social diversity, and hey lcal power to the expanding blocs of ethnic voters who continue to demand more benefits for their imported communities, cultures, and home countries.

Americans have also grown disgusted at their government’s migration policy because it used billions of their dollars to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy- while also causing thousands of deaths among migrants and Americans, plus massive civic damage to the sending countries.

Many polls show Americans’ growing opposition to migration amid expensive propaganda from Powell Jobs and other billionaires.

In February, Lopez used her CatalyzeUS Substack post to claim that Powell Jobs’ pro-migration message is being overpowered by Trump’s pro-enforcement messages.

The best message in the world is useless if no one hears it. Republicans understand this, which is why they aren’t just repeating anti-immigrant lies—they’re saturating every platform, every news cycle, and every medium to ensure no other narrative breaks through. Their propaganda isn’t winning on merit; it’s filling a void left by Democratic silence. While the right floods the airwaves with fearmongering, Democrats act as if polling alone will save them, assuming facts will speak for themselves. But facts don’t win battles—feelings do.

Yet her pro-migration side has far more lobbyists on the payroll, more friendly media coverage, and far more elite support. For example, Powell Jobs uses her multi-billion inheritance from Apple founder Steve Jobs to push for more economic migration that transfers ordinary Americans’ wages to wealthy investors.

Similarly, billionaire Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, and its migration coverage almost entirely ignores the economic and civic damage done by American communities by Biden’s illegal and legal migrants, such as H-1B workers.

Mark Zuckerberg and a truckload of other billionaires helped created the FWD.us lobbying group, which played a huge role in the Biden administration. After the election, its top officials blamed poor messaging for the public’s reaction to the wealth-shifting inflow of roughly 14 million legal and illegal migrants.

“This election was about rebuking the fact that Biden governed on this issue very poorly, and people did not like what they saw, and they were not hearing a coherent policy or messaging answer on what was coming next,” Andrea Flores, the Vice President of Immigration Policy & Campaigns at FWD.us, said in December.

Extraction Migration also does huge damage to migrants, but their suffering is ignored by the establishment media when it cannot be used to sway U.S. politics.",Right

The Trump administration insisted Sunday that it is not required to work with officials in El Salvador to secure the return of a man mistakenly deported to the country, days after the Supreme Court endorsed a federal judge’s directive that US officials must “facilitate” bringing him back stateside.

The argument has the potential of setting up another high-profile showdown between the administration and the federal judiciary over how much power courts have in resolving disputes concerning immigration, particularly ones involving foreign governments.

The assertion, made in court papers by Justice Department lawyers, comes after US District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday ordered the administration to “take all available steps to facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison last month.

“The federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” the DOJ attorneys wrote in the seven-page filing, arguing officials have a duty only to “remove any domestic obstacles” that may stand in the way of Abrego Garcia returning to the US.

An earlier — yet similar — order from Xinis was appealed by the government up to the Supreme Court, which ultimately backed the judge’s order Thursday. The high court, however, did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned, saying instead that the district judge’s directive was unclear and needed clarification.

The Supreme Court noted the clarification needed to be made with “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.”

The administration, the Justice Department lawyers wrote in the Sunday filing, understands “‘facilitate’ to mean what that term has long meant in the immigration context, namely actions allowing an alien to enter the United States.”

“Taking ‘all available steps to facilitate’ the return of Abrego Garcia is thus best read as taking all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here,” they continued. “Indeed, no other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable — or constitutional — here.”

In a separate court filing Sunday, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said in a sworn statement that Abrego Garcia “is no longer eligible for withholding of removal” because of the administration’s claim that he’s a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.

Abrego Garcia was granted protected status by an immigration judge in 2019 that prohibited the federal government from sending him to El Salvador. His attorneys say he fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago. Under the 2019 order, he was still considered removable; it just couldn’t be to El Salvador.

But the assertion by Evan Katz, an official with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, means that if Abrego Garcia were brought back to the US, the government would work quickly to deport him.

Katz’s statement was filed as part of the Justice Department’s daily update on what the administration is doing to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. Xinis ordered the updates last week after a DOJ attorney could not provide details on his exact location.

The Trump administration said in its Saturday filing that Abrego Garcia is “alive and secure” in El Salvador’s mega-prison, CECOT.

“It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” a senior State Department official wrote in the filing. “He is alive and secure in that facility.”",Left

Tesla has suspended taking new orders for Model S and Model X vehicles on its Chinese website, Reuters checks showed on Friday, as the world’s two largest economies exchange blows in a trade war.

Both models are made in the U.S. and imported to China. New orders for the two models were also no longer available on the automaker’s WeChat mini program account in China.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While the company did not give a reason for the move, it comes as China and U.S. have been locked in an escalating trade war. China on Friday raised its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% on Friday after President Donald Trump’s decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%.

Higher U.S. tariffs significantly increases the retail cost for Chinese consumers, making these cars more expensive than locally produced EVs.

The Austin, Texas-based company is least affected by Trump’s tariffs among automakers due to its largely domestic manufacturing for sales in the U.S.

The U.S. automaker makes Model 3 and Model Y cars at its plant in Shanghai for sale in the country and export to markets such as Europe, making up the vast majority of its sales.

China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024, said Li Yanwei, an analyst with the China Auto Dealers Association.

The two models accounted for less 0.5% of Tesla’s deliveries of more than 657,000 vehicles last year.

Increasing competition from BYD 002594.SZ and other local manufacturers has also hit sales of Tesla’s vehicles in China.

Deliveries of the category that includes Tesla’s premium sedan and SUV models and the Cybertruck were down 25% in the first quarter globally, largely due to the lack of upgrades to the vehicles and backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s politics.",Left

The Saturday Night Live alumna — who previously admitted she had an abortion at the age of 23 — announced on Thursday that she has finally welcomed her first baby with her fiancé John MacGregor.

“It’s been a week and a day with my beautiful squirmy baby girl,” Strong wrote in the caption of an Instagram post featuring a photo of herself sleeping beside her newborn daughter’s bassinet.

“I recognize all her little squirms and kicks from when she was on the other side of me and now I get to say ‘see what I was talking about!’ She makes Robert Deniro faces and snorts when she is super determined on the boob. She’s gonna be stronger than me in about a week,” the Schmigadoon! star continued.

Strong added that she screamed “whoo hoo!” during delivery when she noticed her daughter was “born with a full head of dark hair.”

“And I’ve been screaming ‘whoo hoo’ every day since, because she’s absolutely perfect and I won the lottery,” the Ghostbusters actress said before dubbing her daughter’s April 2, 2025 birthday, “World Changing Forever Day.”

“I’m so in love and so tired, it’s like the greatest dream but it’s real,” Strong said, adding, “John is the best dad I could ever have imagined.”

In November, Strong revealed in a lengthy Instagram post that she had conceived a child with the help of IVF, sharing a photo of her baby bump while clad in a t-shirt that read, “pregnant, pro choice, & proud.”

“A couple years ago I did a piece on SNL as Goober the Clown who had an abortion the day before her 23rd birthday. I’m happy to report that same clown is now very happily pregnant from IVF at 40,” the actress said.

Strong then used her pregnancy announcement to pivot to complaining about politics, claiming, “It’s much scarier to think about what could happen after Tuesday’s election” than it is to reveal to the public she is having a baby.

“I currently live in a state where I will be able to receive all the healthcare I may possibly need. But we won’t be safe anywhere in the U.S. if there is national ban like the one promised by Project 2025,” Strong said, bizarrely pushing the Project 2025 hoax before claiming the U.S. Supreme Court “has already decided it’s ok to let some of us die.”

As Breitbart News reported, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February directing the Domestic Policy Council to find ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for Americans.

Notably, fertility procedures like IVF have become unaffordable for many Americans who do not have the same privileges as Strong — a Hollywood actress with an estimated net worth of $4 million who can abort an unborn child in her early 20’s only to turn around and enjoy today’s medical achievements without financial fear.

Comedian and television host Bill Maher revealed on Friday the details of his recent dinner with President Donald Trump in an attempt to emphasize the need for civil discourse rather than ""hurling insults from 3,000 miles away.""
Newsweek reached out by email on Saturday morning, outside of normal business hours, to Maher and Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD) for comment.
Maher, host of HBO's weekly talk show Real Time With Bill Maher, has often spoken out against Trump over the years, making him the butt of jokes. Trump, in return, has often lambasted Maher, calling him ""overrated"" and ""ratings challenged."" Just before the dinner took place, Trump posted on Truth Social that Maher has been ""unjustifiably critical of anything or anyone TRUMP.""
Last month, Maher compared extreme adulation for Trump by his die-hard supporters to that of North Koreans praising their leader Kim Jong-Un. Maher also said that in a hypothetical rematch election between Trump and former President Joe Biden, he would ""vote for Biden's head in a jar of blue liquid versus Donald Trump.""
The comedian has also been critical of ""woke"" progressives, describing himself as an ""old-school liberal."" He has repeatedly raised concerns about the left and what he and many others describe as ""cancel culture."" He touts dialogue between political factions as important and maintains friendships with prominent conservatives, who he also features on his show.
Maher and Trump met after musician Kid Rock, a mutual friend, arranged the dinner.
Trump, in his lengthy Truth Social post ahead of the dinner, said he agreed to the dinner as a ""favor for a friend."" Maher said he did not pursue the dinner as a form of political reconciliation, but rather because ""there's got to be something better than hurling insults from 3000 miles away.""
The video in which the comedian spoke about his dinner with the president, which was posted to X, formerly Twitter, had been reposted over 11,000 times with over 4 million views by noon on Saturday.
""What I'm going to do is report exactly what happened,"" Maher said at the start of his monologue in this week's episode. ""You decide what you think about it, and if that's not enough, pure Trump hate for you, I don't give a f***.""
The comedian's opening was a nod to progressive critics, who have slammed his White House meeting with Trump. Maher routinely sparks outrage from some progressives for his willingness to engage with conservatives, and his criticism of some left-wing positions.
Maher revealed he found Trump to be ""gracious and measured,"" finding it strange that he ""isn't that in other setting."" As an example of this unexpected good humor, Maher showed off a list of 60 insults Trump had said about him, which he had brought to the dinner and had Trump sign.
""Stupid, dummy, low life, sleaze bag, sick, sad, stoned, cold, crazy, a dumb guy,"" Maher rattled off from the list before turning it around to show Trump's signature, adding that the president did it ""with good humor,"" quipping that he expected anything nice he said about Trump to cause ""millions of liberal sphincters"" to tighten.""

Maher sprinkled jabs at Trump throughout his account of the evening, such as quipping that he wasn't going to ""dress like [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky"" in reference to the Ukrainian leader's ill-fated visit to the White House.
He also revealed that he joked about the high-profile lawsuit Trump filed against him in 2013 when Maher parodied Trump's birther claims about former President Barack Obama by claiming the real estate mogul's father was an ape and offered to make a $5 million donation if he could prove he wasn't half ape. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed without prejudice just eight weeks later.
""He said to Dana White, 'You know, Bill said my father was an orangutan, and I really love my father,'"" Maher said, adding that he retorted, ""Well, Mr. President, I did that because I didn't like what you were doing regarding Obama's birth origins. I thought that was low.""
""No anger, just a little smile, as if to say, 'Yea, I get it,'"" Maher said.
He explained later: ""The most surreal part of the whole night was when I got home, I flew back right after the dinner, and I'm in bed watching 60 Minutes from the night before, and there's Trump in one of their stories, standing at a podium in a room that looked to me like one of the rooms and places we'd just been in and he's ranting—""Disgusting. You're a terrible person""—and I'm like, 'Who's that guy? What happened to Glinda, the good witch? And why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy?'""
""I'm not saying it's our responsibility to do that,"" Maher added. ""It's not I'm just reporting exactly what I saw.""
""A crazy person doesn't live in the White House—a person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is f***ed up,"" he said. ""It's just not as f***ed up as I thought it was, and I have no illusions now that I'm back to work at my job, that he might start a new list.""
Concluding his monologue, Maher again pushed back against progressive criticism.
""OK, that's my report. You can hate me for it, but I'm not a liar. Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know. And I can't answer, and it's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw, and I wasn't high,"" he said.
Later in the show, Maher sparred with panelist Josh Rogin, a columnist at The Washington Post, as Rogin critiqued the comedian's dinner with Trump.
""Not everybody has to like it,"" Maher shot back. ""That's what we said, there were people who didn't want it to happen at all. You sound like one of them.""
""What is the alternative to not talking?"" the comedian asked. ""Just sit at your lunch table and don't talk to anybody?""
Rogin responded by saying the dinner was a ""PR stunt"" for Trump and that Maher had been used as a ""prop.""
Former GOP Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""Oh [Bill Maher], you think much too highly of yourself to think anyone would 'hate' you for having dinner with Trump. But you do sound super naive.""
He added: ""So Trump, the man who lies as he breathes, the man who tried to overthrow an American election, the man who purposely spreads cruelty & division to win, the man who is throwing innocent people in an El Salvador prison, the man who is siding with Putin, the man who is expelling people bcuz of their beliefs, the man who thinks he's a dictator, the man who is ordering the justice dept to go after his political enemies, the man who is trying to tear down our democracy & the rule of law...that man is sort of 'gracious & measured' in private? Really Bill? Screw that. With everything Trump is doing PUBLICLY to this country I love, I don't give a damn what he's like in PRIVATE. Shame on you Bill. All you did was normalize him. Maybe that's good for your ratings, but it's bad for the country.""
Collin Rugg, co-owner of conservative commentary site Trending Politics, wrote on X: ""Bill Maher says he was completely wrong about Trump, says he felt way more comfortable with Trump than he would have with Clinton or Obama. The reflection after 8 years of railing on the president comes after Maher visited the White House.""
U.S. ambassador to Israel and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee wrote on X: ""This is so good! What [Bill Maher] saw in [Donald Trump] is what most of us who know & love POTUS see when we are with him. Listen & learn!""
Far-right political activist Laura Loomer wrote on X: ""So sick of Bill Maher Simps. Conservatives are so desperate to be friends with people who hate them. All I know is I had a productive week in Cali, which included my deposition of Bill Maher. It's all on video and transcribed. You won't see me kissing his ass.""
Kyle Kulinski, a progressive political commentator and podcast host, wrote on X: ""Bill Maher, like Rogan, is so washed and going out sad.""
Real Time With Bill Maher airs on HBO on Fridays at 10 p.m. ET, with a second airing on CNN on Saturdays at 8 p.m. ET.

The Department of Homeland Security has administered lie detector tests to about 50 staffers in recent weeks, including FEMA’s acting administrator and roughly a dozen officials at the disaster relief agency, as part of an intensifying effort to root out what the department alleges are leaks of national security information.

Acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton, an appointee of President Donald Trump, was given a polygraph just days after taking part in a meeting with top DHS officials for a policy discussion on the future of FEMA and how to potentially dismantle the agency in the coming months. That closed-door meeting was reported by CNN and other media outlets.

At least one FEMA official has been placed on administrative leave and was escorted out of the agency’s office this week after being administered a polygraph test, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

“We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment, or status as a career civil servant — we will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CNN.

The investigations at DHS have raised concerns that the lie detector tests may be used on federal workers accused of leaking non-classified information to the media, particularly at FEMA where sources say classified information is handled in very limited circumstances. Whistleblower support organizations tell CNN it would be unusual, alarming and potentially illegal for the tests to be used in such cases.

One FEMA official, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution, said: “They’re going after rank-and-file employees and instilling this culture of fear.”

The Trump administration, including at DHS and the Department of Defense, has launched various investigations involving polygraphs into unauthorized disclosures of classified and national security information.

Some FEMA officials “failed” the test, McLaughlin said, declining to provide details on what information was allegedly leaked. She insisted DHS is following the law.

“We will take appropriate action and, in some cases, refer some for criminal prosecution based on additional evidence found,” McLaughlin said in an email to CNN.

McLaughlin said Hamilton’s polygraph cleared him. Hamilton remains in his job. CNN has reached out to him for comment. Politico first reported he was administered the test.

The FEMA official told CNN that the idea DHS is only testing workers accused of leaking classified information is “extremely farcical” based on knowing some of the people who were given the tests and the positions they hold.

“They are just covering up the unpopular stuff they’re doing,” the official said. “FEMA is a consumer of classified information, not a producer of classified information, and the FEMA programs that are truly classified are all an extremely small group of people.”

A second FEMA official called the tests “a witch hunt.”

“I find it very, very hard to believe that within the normal course of business, any of these employees had their hands on classified material,” the official said. “They are trying to incite fear. They are trying to get rid of people.”

Tom Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability Project, a non-partisan, nonprofit whistleblower support organization, said he’s surprised by the number of polygraphs administered in just the first three months of the Trump administration.

“Government agencies for decades, have used lie detectors to catch leakers or anyone else they perceived as wrongdoers. The difference here is the volume,” Devine said. “What used to be a sensitive, carefully considered high-risk decision, is now a knee-jerk reaction, and that’s what’s scary.”

As CNN previously reported, experts have questioned the validity of polygraphs, as they are subject to coercion and can be unreliable, ﻿and they are often inadmissible in court.

The tests come against the backdrop of growing tension between FEMA’s workforce and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the disaster relief agency. Trump and his allies have lambasted FEMA for months, claiming the agency is partisan, ineffective and unnecessary. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has vowed to “eliminate FEMA.”

Noem, DHS and the Elon Musk-led DOGE effort are seeking potentially major cuts at FEMA. Last week, FEMA staff were offered voluntary separations and early retirement as part of the latest iteration of the Deferred Resignation Program.

Multiple FEMA officials tell CNN they expect the offer will spark a mass exodus from the disaster relief organization amid the mounting turmoil and cratering morale, which some fear will impact the agency’s ability to respond to storms during hurricane season.

“Far more employees are considering or taking the [voluntary resignation offers],” the first FEMA official said. “You have the potential for a ton of institutional knowledge to walk out the door, and then you have a double whammy if you don’t have enough manpower to meet the mission, even if it’s an average hurricane season.”

CNN previously reported that the turmoil at FEMA is already affecting the agency’s hurricane preparations. The FEMA official warns that response teams and resources could be stretched thin if the US faces a storm season like last year, when Hurricanes Helene and Milton pounded the Southeast in succession.",Left

Zack Peter, the host of the popular pop culture podcast ""No Filter,"" is not impressed with celebrities who have become overly political as of late.
On social media or on big awards show stages, Hollywood stars have let viewers know where they stand on hot-button issues – whether they wanted to know or not. Peter singled out Rachel Zegler and Selena Gomez as two of the more recent vocal celebrities.
In January, Gomez posted a video to her Instagram in which she cried over the state of immigration in the U.S. Based on her next moves, including walking the Oscars red carpet in an expensive ensemble, Peter suggested her teary message was for show.
""People are kind of just tired of Hollywood telling us what we're supposed to do,"" Peter told Fox News Digital. ""I think this past year has been pretty indicative of that. You know, Hollywood virtue signaling and pretending that they care about these causes. Like Selena Gomez, remember when she was just a few weeks ago crying about immigration and then two weeks after that, she's on a red carpet dripped out in jewels and suddenly immigration is just not important to her anymore?""

""All my people are getting attacked, the children,"" Gomez said through tears in the Instagram video. ""I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something, but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise.""
She deleted the message shortly afterward, before posting another, now-deleted Instagram story with a caption reading, ""Apparently it’s not okay to show empathy for people.""
""So I think people just feel like it's fake, right?"" Peter said. ""It's a lot of virtue signaling. It's a lot of pandering that I think people are just tired of. We don't want to be lectured to.""
""Snow White"" star Rachel Zegler's own controversial social media posts were partly blamed for the underwhelming box-office performance of Disney's remake of the 1937 animated classic the past few weeks. In the months leading up to the film's release, Zegler posted ""Free Palestine"" on X, and wished on Instagram that President Donald Trump and his supporters ""never know peace.""

When asked how Hollywood has reacted to Trump's second term, Peter again questioned celebrities' motives and whether they're actually helping to solve the issues they're sounding off on.
""So I think people have kind of tuned out when celebrities make their political-pandering comments on social media, unless you're really like Rachel Zegler where you're coming out strong with an opinion that is kind of polarizing,"" he said. ""I think there's a way to share your support for something without isolating people at the same time. And so I think we need more of that. If you're going to talk about it, at least try to make the message unifying rather than creating more political division."" 
""And then when it comes to Trump specifically, I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen many – I think what you have like the Jane Fondas who are going to go out and use the award stage to make a comment about how woke just means empathy, but I see a lot of Hollywood doubling down on things that I think clearly just missed the mark,"" he added.

While accepting her Life Achievement Award at the 2025 Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards, veteran actress Jane Fonda defended the word ""woke"" as simply meaning that one ""cares.""
""What we [actors] create is empathy,"" Fonda said. ""Our job is to understand another human being so profoundly that we can touch their souls.""
Despite how prominent their perches are, Peter noted, liberal celebrities' influence is clearly limited based on who won the 2024 election.

""If Hollywood had the power that it had, Kamala Harris would have been elected president,"" Peter told Fox News Digital. ""And we're just seeing that people just aren't in touch with celebrities anymore or their political statements. So I don't think they're really having much sway, especially with this new administration.""

The latest ridiculous lie from Democrats about how Republicans are driving the country towards fascism is out, and it is a doozy. This time, we are meant to believe that Trump and the GOP are banning married women from voting.
Spoiler Alert: They aren’t.
REAL ID DEADLINE FOR TRAVELERS, SOME FEDERAL BUILDING ACCESS QUICKLY APPROACHING
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and others took to video this week to make the nonsensical and logically tortured claim, saying, ""House Republicans’ so-called ‘SAVE Act’ blocks nearly 70 million women from registering to vote—just because they changed their name after marriage.""
Here is what failed glass-ceiling breaker Hillary Clinton had to say: ""The House just passed the Republican voter suppression measure that threatens voting access for millions of Americans, including 69 million women whose married names don’t match their birth certificates.""
Miami, Florida, Miami International Airport, TSA checkpoint security screening, Real ID sign.  (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act requires proof of citizenship to cast a vote in federal elections. Among the acceptable documents for demonstrating proof of citizenship are: A REAL ID-compliant driver’s license, a valid U.S. passport, and a military ID.
You would think the driver's license requirement would be simple enough, but then again, blue-state Democrats screwed that up when they insisted on giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants whose supporting documents could not be verified. Now, the rest of us have to get extra verification for our driver's licenses so they can be distinguished from the ones handed out like candy to illegal aliens.
So now, Democrats are seriously suggesting that married women in our country are all but incapable of obtaining verified identification and therefore will be disenfranchised by Republicans, presumably while they twist their handlebar mustaches and kick some puppies.
I’d like to ask Rep. Swalwell, if married women are incapable of getting IDs such as a driver's license, then why is there an almost endless line of them in cars in front of me at the school pick-up line?
Furthermore, I am given to understand that married women quite regularly travel abroad. If they can’t get a passport, then how is this happening? Are their husbands bribing border officials?
… there are approximately 70 million married women in the United States who may have taken their spouse's last name, which means there are 70 million Americans who know damn well how easily they can obtain valid ID.
If, in fact, there is some intractable issue preventing married women from getting ID, then we should fix it. But given that nobody had ever heard of this ""major problem"" until Republicans brought up a voter ID law, it is, well, suspicious.
This is especially true, given that up to 80% of Americans support showing valid ID to vote, yet instead of honoring the will of the people, the left, once again, goes charging towards facile identity politics.
You have to hand it to the Democrats. When they latch onto a message, they immediately start yelling it in unison with all the subtlety of a sky-writing competition, like last month, when they all started cursing like Andrew Dice Clay one day.
As cosmically stupid and demonstrably false as it is, this claim that married women will be disparately impacted, or uniquely disadvantaged by the voter ID law is par for a very dangerous course that the Democrats run over and over.
According to the Democrats, we can’t have safer streets because minorities or the poor will be arrested more often, we can’t protect women in sports because that violates trans rights and now we can’t secure the vote because married women don’t know how to get IDs.
This is all ""disparate impact ad absurdum."" if there is one non-white, non-straight, non-cis person in America who faces a negative consequence from legislation, then the whole thing has to be tanked. 
Meanwhile, Democrats push policies like student debt relief that clearly disadvantages Americans who never went to college, but in this case somehow the discrimination is enlightened.

The final nail in the coffin of this insane notion that the GOP wants to disenfranchise everyone with ""Mrs."" in front of her name, or in Democrats opinion, his or her name, is that married women lean Republican in their voting.
In fact, recent polling has shown that with full voter participation, the Republicans and Trump would have won by even more in 2024, so why on earth would the GOP want to leave those votes on the table?

Ultimately, what the Democrats have here is a reality problem. As Swalwell pointed out, there are approximately 70 million married women in the United States who may have taken their spouse's last name, which means there are 70 million Americans who know damn well how easily they can obtain valid ID.
So get out there and vote, married ladies. There is literally nothing stopping you.

In the course of reviewing social science literature in conjunction with my forthcoming book, ""God Was Right: How Modern Social Science Proves the Torah is True,"" I have come across a strange subgenre of research. It is in the use of hallucinogens for spiritual growth. 
This practice happens often at festivals (such as Burning Man), but elsewhere as well, and not just at annual occasions. Indeed, the practice of ""microdosing"" has people take ""small"" doses of psychedelic substances frequently. A major purpose of this practice is to enable people to have ""spiritual"" experiences.
It is popular. According to a 2022 study from Columbia University (using data from 2019), 5.5 million Americans use hallucinogens a year. This number is surely greater now, especially given the significant number of popular television shows that now celebrate the use of psychedelics and that they are legal in some states.
The Torah wants us to microdose spirituality – through properly conceiving our all-day/everyday activities. (Fox)
What would the Torah – which, of course, has a lot to convey about spirituality (often referred to as ""holiness"") – say about this practice?
TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FROM, NOT JUST SEE
The first answer comes from Deuteronomy 4:9, where we are instructed to ""guard yourself very well."" This is an imperative to be healthy. The use of hallucinogens is certainly not that. 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that ""bad trips"" are common – with, often, severe outcomes. These include self-harm, harming others, paranoia, fear, anxiety, convulsions, seizures, alienation from loved ones and flashbacks that can occur at any time in the future.
The second answer from the Torah may be gleaned from an unlikely source – Numbers 6, where God speaks with Moses about people who choose to take ""a Nazirite vow of abstinence.""
One who takes a Nazarite vow, the text explains, abstains from a variety of things: drinking wine, shaving and coming near a dead person (including parents and siblings). He is the ascetic par excellence. At the conclusion of this period, he must bring a sin-offering to the temple. The sin-offering indicates that the person who took the vow of abstinence did something wrong.
THE DESTRUCTIVE POLITICS OF HATE VS. THE POWER OF FAITH
What could it be? It is, it seems, the same thing that the users of hallucinogens do. They look for spirituality by detaching from the world. The Nazarite does so by remaining in the society – but by forbidding himself otherwise permissible things, in order to achieve a higher sense of spirituality. The hallucinogen user goes even further, and detaches himself from the world by taking substances whose entire purpose is to transport him to another plane.  
What is the problem with this? Again, the Torah has the answer. In Exodus 25:8, God tells the newly freed Jewish ex-slaves to build a sanctuary. The wording of his command is deeply instructive. God says: ""They shall make a Sanctuary for me – so that I may dwell among them…"" Not, as we might expect, ""dwell in it"" – but ""dwell among them.""  
God is teaching us that he wants to dwell – he wants spirituality to be identified and experienced – in between people, in the real world of daily activities.

This message is reinforced throughout the Torah. In Exodus 31:5, God fills the artisan Betzalel with ""a divine"" spirit to do his labors – showing that stonecutting, woodworking and weaving can be sacred activities. 
Time and again, the Torah is clear: We don’t find God or achieve spiritual heights by detaching from the world. (iStock)
In Leviticus 19, God issues a lot of ethical principles and moral laws (such as not cursing the deaf, placing a stumbling block before the blind and gossiping). He punctuates each one by saying, ""I am Hashem"" – showing that our daily interactions are spiritually important. 
In Deuteronomy 14:23, God tells the people to ""tithe the crop of your planting"" and then ""eat before Hashem"" – showing that the simple act of eating after giving is a moment for spiritual celebration. And in Exodus and Deuteronomy, we are commanded to ""sanctify the Sabbath day"" – teaching us that we can create a day of spiritual magnitude every week.

Time and again, the Torah is clear: We don’t find God or achieve spiritual heights by detaching from the world. We do so by attaching to the world. The Torah wants us to microdose spirituality – through properly conceiving our all-day/everyday activities. If we see every action, meal, conversation, decision and interaction as an opportunity to do something holy – to, as Leviticus 19:2 instructs, ""Be holy"" – our days will be full of profound spiritual experiences. 
And we’ll experience these spiritual highs much more frequently, dependably, meaningfully and safely than any drug microdoser – and enjoy the social joys and benefits that the escapist cannot experience.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week made his strongest endorsement yet of the measles vaccine amid an ongoing outbreak that has killed three and infected more than 600 people across the US.

But his recent push for people to get vaccinated for measles stands in stark contrast to Kennedy’s years of work against measles vaccines, including suing the state of New York for its vaccine mandates, and making numerous claims that the shot is dangerous and unnecessary.

Kennedy’s comments on X last Sunday that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, “is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” set off vaccine critics who saw the statement as a betrayal of the health secretary’s longtime views on vaccine safety.

“Bobby Kennedy was our founder, but Bobby Kennedy is now the Secretary of HHS,” Mary Holland, CEO of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, said in a video statement. “He certainly left off that in my personal experience, and in the personal experience of many people at CHD, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine was extremely injurious.”

Holland went on to repeat disproven claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism.

The health secretary followed up this Thursday with a Fox News interview, where he told host Martha MacCallum that it is “very hard to tell” whether measles deaths this year could have been averted with vaccinations. “We need to do better at treating kids who have this disease, and not just saying the only answer is vaccination.”

He also discussed the health agency’s “massive research and testing” plan to find the causes of autism by this September, a project he said will probe vaccinations along with environmental exposures, food and societal factors.

While Kennedy has been most critical of Covid-19 vaccines in recent years, MMR immunizations have been one of his earliest and most consistent targets for misinformation and alarm over the last two decades.

CNN reached out to HHS for comment regarding Kennedy’s past and recent remarks on MMR vaccines.

As Kennedy wrote in his 2023 book with Brian Hooker, Vax-Unvax, “The MMR vaccine is the tip of the spear regarding the modern debate around vaccine safety.”

Here are three ways Kennedy questioned the vaccine’s safety and the severity of measles infections themselves.

Linking MMR vaccines to debunked risks

The theory that MMR vaccines led to autism first took hold with a since-retracted 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield. As the disbarred British physician rose to prominence in the anti-vaccine world, so did Kennedy — who repeatedly defended his debunked research.

“Wakefield [and his co-researchers] did not state that MMR causes autism,” Kennedy and Hooker wrote in their 2023 book. “They merely pointed out the timing of the vaccine before the onset of symptoms.”

Ten of the 12 co-authors on the study issued a retraction in 2004, saying it established no causal link between the MMR shot and autism. Infants with autism typically start showing signs between 12-24 months of age; the first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given when a child is 12 months old.

Kennedy, like Wakefield, has asserted over the years that MMR vaccines lead to myriad adverse events besides autism.

MMR vaccines have an “unconscionably high injury rate” Kennedy wrote on CHD’s website in 2019, citing gastrointestinal and respiratory complications from a mid-1970s study. Those are symptoms “that might persuade rational consumers to choose the infections over the vaccine,” he added.

This March, speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Kennedy repeated the claim that the vaccines themselves are as risky at the virus. “[The MMR vaccine] causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes,” and leads to “deaths every year,” he said.

There are no reported deaths from the vaccine among healthy people, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America.

Downplaying severity of measles infections

Kennedy has repeatedly said that measles outbreaks are not unusual, infection is not severe in healthy people, and deaths with measles are due to other causes.

“If you look at the kids in Africa who die from measles, or these other infectious diseases, they’re all malnourished,” he said on Joe Rogan’s podcast in June 2023. “It’s hard for a disease to kill a healthy person; it’s hard for an infectious disease to kill a healthy person with a rugged immune system.”

State health departments reported no underlying health conditions reported in the three US deaths this year, the first measles deaths in the country in a decade. All three, two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico, were unvaccinated. In the Fox interview Thursday, Kennedy suggested at least one of the children had prior medical complications.

Kennedy also this year dismissed the notion that many died from measles in a 2019 Samoan outbreak that killed 83 and infected more than 5,000 people.

Details of Kennedy’s visit to Samoa months before the 2019 outbreak resurfaced during his Senate confirmation hearings. He went to the country following an invitation from an anti-vaccine advocate, but denies he campaigned against vaccination while he was there. He also denied to senators that dozens of people died from the virus.

“Most of the people did not have measles,” when tissue samples were tested, he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) “We don’t know what was killing them.”

That claim is a “total fabrication,” Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press. Ekeroma also said Kennedy met with anti-vaccine advocates while there.

Lawsuit over MMR vaccine requirements

Kennedy, along with former federal prosecutor Michael Sussman, sued the state of New York in 2019 to oppose vaccine requirement for school-age children. The state’s legislature passed the law, which removed religious exemptions, amid a measles outbreak that year among Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish community that infected nearly 800 people.

A state Supreme Court justice rejected the suit days later. The Kennedy-chaired Children’s Health Defense vowed to keep fighting.

That same year, Kennedy rallied with Washington state residents against a MMR vaccine mandate for children attending school. At the time, there were roughly 50 reported measles cases in the state. It spread to 71 people, most of them unvaccinated children, during the monthslong outbreak.

As health secretary, Kennedy has maintained that position that vaccination should be a choice despite the spread of measles across 23 states.

“The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS News April 8. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”",Left

After then-President Biden’s disastrous debate performance in June, she threatened to withhold cash to the Democratic Party until Biden dropped out of the 2024 race.

The interviewer, Guardian reporter John Harris, noted his bewilderment that there aren’t millions of Americans mobilizing in the streets, and Disney suggested a key reason why.
""We could all show up on the streets. But what would be the uniting message?"" the heiress asked. ""The chaos is deliberate: it’s meant to give us too much to handle. Do we go out there about the environment? Do we go out there about DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion policies]? Do we go out there about gay rights, about women’s rights?""
Disney went on to argue, ""You know, the difficulty of being progressive is that it’s difficult to unite everybody around a single issue. So most of the progressives I know are trying to figure that out. And even if we did go out [on the streets], what is our leverage? We have none.""

We have a cabinet that is so radical, and they are lining the government with people who are beyond radical and there is no place where we can exercise visible dissent … We’re being shut out,"" Disney said.

The president of the United States recently praised Hannibal Lecter for helping him win reelection, suggested he was “purposely” crashing the economy, and then abruptly paused most of his tariffs, which he described as both up for negotiation and “permanent.” So you might think making zany and contradictory public declarations isn’t the kind of thing that bothers members of Donald Trump’s second administration. But Howard Lutnick found a way.

Recent reporting on the Commerce secretary reads like a Politico cover of “Not Like Us.” Last month, the outlet reported that both White House officials and Trump’s outside allies have grown “increasingly frustrated” with Lutnick due to his attempts to ingratiate himself with the president, his tendency to give terrible policy advice, and his “abrasive personality.” One Politico source accused Lutnick of “trying to be a mini-Trump,” while another described him as “a new voice at the table pushing crazy shit,” adding, “I don’t know anyone that isn’t pissed off at him.”

Lutnick’s frequent, often embarrassing public statements are only making matters worse. The secretary has announced policies that Trump has yet to approve and made various jaw-dropping claims, like when he suggested Americans are eager to serve in “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones.” Lutnick’s media appearances “have proven so challenging to White House officials that he was asked to curb them” back in March, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Nevertheless, Lutnick was the most prominent cheerleader for Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and he’s continued to be a font of darkly hilarious sycophancy in both his on-air appearances and his fawning social media posts. Here’s a running list of Lutnick’s most lunkheaded public statements.

. During a March 9 appearance on Meet the Press, Lutnick said we should “absolutely not” brace for an economic downturn as “there’s going to be no recession in America.” He went on to promise that Trump would “grow our economy in a way we’ve never grown before,” adding, “if Donald Trump is bringing growth to America, I would never bet on recession, no chance.” Howard Lutnick:

""There's going to be no recession in America""

""Global tariffs are going to come down"" pic.twitter.com/3jhuTNd0pa — Aaron Bennett (@AaronDBennett) March 9, 2025 But Trump was way less confident, or at least less willing to make a potentially humiliating declaration on camera. That same day, the president declined to rule out a recession on Fox Sunday Morning Futures, saying “I hate to predict things like that.”

. Days later, CBS News asked Lutnick if Trump’s tariffs are justified even if they spark a recession. “This policies are the most important thing America has ever had,” the secretary answered, passionately, adding, “It is worth it.” Q: ""Will these policies be worth it if they lead to a recession, even a short-term recession?""



Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick: ""These policies are the most important thing America has ever had.""



Q: ""So it is worth it?""



Lutnick: ""It is worth it."" pic.twitter.com/yC9ooJ07e5 — The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 12, 2025 Lutnick quickly added that he doesn’t think there will be a recession. And if there is, it won’t be caused by the current president but “the Biden nonsense that we had to live with.” Then the Commerce secretary insisted that the tariffs — which Trump would later implement only to delay less than a week later — weren’t tumultuous at all. “It is not chaotic and the only one who thinks it’s chaotic is someone who’s being silly,” Lutnick said.

. In the same “recession is worth it” interview, Lutnick told CBS that Trump is looking to abolish taxes for a huge swath of Americans. “I know what his goal is: No tax for anybody who makes less than $150,000 a year. That’s his goal. That’s what I’m working for,” he said. Big if true! Which, as it turns out, it wasn’t. He later clarified in a Fox News appearance, “that’s aspirational.” MacCallum: You said on CBS that Trump wants no taxes on people making below $150,000



Lutnick: That's taking it out of context… That's aspirational that when we balance the budget… pic.twitter.com/idWnvKmA4J — Acyn (@Acyn) March 13, 2025

. During a March 19 appearance on Fox News, Lutnick praised Elon Musk extensively and said viewers should buy stock in his car company. “I think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,” Lutnick said. “It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again.” On Jesse Watters’ show, Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who served as the chairman and CEO of a major financial services firm for 34 years, tells viewers they should buy Tesla stock.

. During a March 23 appearance on the All-In podcast, Lutnick claimed that most seniors wouldn’t complain if their Social Security check didn’t show up — and if they did, that’s a sign that they’re a “fraudster.” “Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain,” Lutnick said. “She just wouldn’t. She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling, and complaining,” Howard Lutnick: ""Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month, my mother-in-law— who's 94— she wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't.” @Ronxyz00

pic.twitter.com/POE7VTZdmk — The Intellectualist (@highbrow_nobrow) March 21, 2025 Lutnick is right: that particular 94-year-old woman probably wouldn’t complain, as her son-in-law is a billionaire. But would the 40 percent of older Americans who rely solely on Social Security income say something about a missing check? Well, they’d better not, unless they want to spark a fraud investigation.

. The real reason the European Union won’t import certain U.S. meats is that they are chock full of chemicals, but this probably went over better with the MAGA crowd. Lutnick: ""European Union won't take chicken from America ... they hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak."" pic.twitter.com/dcB7gX4LhR — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 3, 2025

. So how exactly is Trump’s trade war going to create American jobs in a timely fashion when it takes years to build a factory? Robots! In an interview with Fox News’ Jesse Watters, Lutnick claimed that low-wage factory workers in foreign countries are going to be replaced by fancy robots in the good old U.S. of A. That may sound like robots are taking our jobs, but the secretary explained Americans are going to … fix the robots or something? Honestly, Lutnick’s word salad was kind of hard to follow. But the bottom line is ROBOTS! Get excited! Commerce Secretary @HowardLutnick tells Primetime that robot manufacturing is going to revive the American workforce. pic.twitter.com/7jjai8dNFp — Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) April 4, 2025

. When asked to provide details on the coming robot revolution on Face the Nation, Lutnick was hazy on whether that would actually come to pass, or Trump’s trade deals would just create American sweat shops. “Well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little – little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” he said, “It’s going to be automated and great Americans — the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They’re going to be mechanics. There’s going to be HVAC specialists. There’s going to be electricians, the tradecraft of America.” Lutnick: ""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones -- that kind of thing is going to come to America."" pic.twitter.com/g9TqxGxLHs — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 6, 2025

. You can laugh now, but someday we’re going to see a “Room Where It Happens”-style Broadway number about Lutnick and Bessent watching Trump wage a trade war via Truth Social. Scott Bessent and I sat with the President while he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency.

. Hey, at least he’s honest! The Golden Age is coming. We are committed to protecting our interests, engaging in global negotiations and exploding our economy. — Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) April 10, 2025

. In a major concession late on Friday, the Trump administration announced that a range of electronics would be exempt from Trump’s new “Liberation Day” tariffs, including smartphones, computers, semiconductor-based storage devices, and flat panels. When Lutnick was asked about the exemptions during an interview with This Week on Sunday morning, he said all the products would be subject to another new tariff soon: All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they’re going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored. … So what [Trump’s] doing is he’s saying they’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two. So these are coming soon. You shouldn’t think this is really outside of it. Really think of it as being included in the semiconductor space. After Pres. Trump exempts tech like phones, computers and chips from new tariffs, Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick tells @JonKarl they will be included in semiconductor tariffs to be released in coming months.

It gets harder every day to track the chaos emanating from Donald Trump’s America. The stock market has gyrated wildly, and we are now locked in an unprecedented trade war with China, facing 125 percent tariffs from Beijing that are sparking a whole lot of panic-buying of iPhones. Trump is living his 40-year dream of threatening enormous tariffs on everyone — and Americans can do little more than nervously look on and hope their 401(k)s don’t evaporate.

In the meantime, the Democratic Party has struggled over how to respond. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a potential 2028 candidate, was lambasted by liberals for offering praise for some tariffs in a recent Washington speech and then ending up, awkwardly, in the Oval Office as Trump signed executive orders. The tariff fight, at first glance, seemed prototypical for a party in disarray: There was no leader to settle on a message, and the Democrats’ college-educated base, reflexively anti-Trump, decided that backing any kind of tariff at all was tantamount to donning a MAGA hat, never mind that Joe Biden kept many of Trump’s first-term China tariffs in place. Whitmer, who had been in Washington to discuss federal business with Trump but never intended to be part of a photo-op, was emblematic of it all: a rising star perhaps rising no more, walking away with less political capital than whatever she had possessed a day earlier.

But beyond these headlines, there’s good news for Democrats. Trump is steadily growing more unpopular, and Americans judge him harshly for his stewardship of the economy. That was always, over the past decade, his ace in the hole. No matter how unhinged he seemed, Americans could always say that, under Trump, the stock market was up and their grocery bills were affordable. No more. The resistance to Trump today still looks little like it did eight years ago, in terms of scale and cultural penetration, but it might end up more effective.

It is, at the very minimum, far more focused on tangible governing and economic matters.

Trump dominates the news cycle, but he does not enjoy the same psychic and cultural permeation he had during his first four years in office, when his antics were still novel and every person on the left felt compelled to respond to each provocation. This was the great flaw of the 2010s resistance: It never focused on any particular cause for too long a period of time, and it didn’t always know what would resonate most with the public. Some of the resistance was well-meaning; some of it was self-serving. And some of it, like literally praying for Robert Mueller to indict Trump and drag him from office, was delusional. The votive candles were real, and they were objectively insane.

As we exit the era of hyperpolitics, we find a healthier environment for resistance and protest. If the protests are not as large as the collective uprisings of the past decade, they are based in a reality with clear electoral implications. The focus on Elon Musk is wise. He is deeply unpopular, and he is the reason at least 100,000 federal employees have lost their jobs. He is the reason Americans are going to have a much harder time trying to talk to a person from the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Social Security Administration. Republicans may gut Medicaid as Trump cheers them on. Even the market gyrations will be fodder for this new resistance, making the Democrats the party of sensible economics. Running on saving someone’s 401(k) isn’t the worst idea in the world.

Trump can be thanked for tugging liberals away from their baser impulses, and he is doing far more direct damage in his second term. In the first term, he largely left the economy and the federal bureaucracy alone, preferring to focus on corporate tax cuts and a limited tariff regime that was not especially disruptive. Trump 2.0 has optimized the resistance to his White House: No need to fall too deeply into the trap of faculty-lounge liberalism or even bray about fascism when the threats are far more obvious. Mass layoffs, deportations of green-card holders, and cuts to health care are plenty to be outraged about. And all of them play into the hands of Democrats who will have much to campaign on in the midterms next year.

If Trump posed a threat to democracy and the functioning of government in his first term, the backlash to his policies always carried the whiff of the hypothetical. A lot of resistance was about what Trump might do. Until the pandemic, the daily reality of American life didn’t change all that radically under Trump the first time round. With DOGE and trade wars, we are in a very different era, and liberals have far better arguments now. Even if activism never reaches its old peaks, there will be enough organic outrage to harness and enough persuasion to be done for the voters who gave Trump another shot in 2024 and are now rethinking their choice. As woeful as the Democrats may seem, there’s a decent chance that if a presidential election, by magic, were held tomorrow, their generic nominee would beat Trump. The MAGA honeymoon is long over, and it’s not coming back.",Left

Former world No. 1 Stan Smith tells CNN Sports it is “unfortunate” that tennis seems to be experiencing “a lot of the same issues we had back 50 years ago.”

His comments come after the Professional Tennis Players’ Association (PTPA), the tennis players’ association co-founded by Novak Djokovic, filed multiple lawsuits around the world against the sport’s tours and governing bodies.

The suits allege the “monopolization” of men’s and women’s tennis and the “disregard” of player interests, accusing the governing organizations of operating “as a cartel.”

The ATP and WTA both disagreed with the lawsuit and said in statements they would defend their positions “vigorously.”

“It’s unfortunate that you have a group of players that are in the Players’ Association, not only ATP but the WTA,” Smith tells CNN. “The ITF has always been the elephant that has been so powerful but trying to control the game.

“So I understand that part, but it’s really unfortunate to see the players not able to work it out. Some of the things they’re asking for have been things that have been improved dramatically, over the conditions of play, certainly the prize money has grown.

“There’s concern about the amount of prize money at the major tournaments and that, I think, could be negotiated to a certain extent.

“Obviously the ITF, the grand slam events are the ones that have the most money,” Smith adds, “and the players are important to those events, and those events are important to the players. So I hope there’s a compromise there in this whole situation.”

Smith spoke to CNN as a part of his tour for his new book “Winning Trust: How To Create Moments That Matter,” which was released last month.

Last week, French sports outlet L’Équipe reported that the top-20-ranked male and female players cosigned a letter to organizers of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open requesting a “substantial increase” in prize money.

Qinweng Zheng, the women’s singles gold medalist at last year’s Paris Olympics, called the letter a “really positive” step for the sport.

Smith, who became an icon in both the tennis and fashion world after having an Adidas sneaker named after him, certainly knows a thing or two about player power.

In 1968, star tennis players began leaving what was then an amateur sport and defecting to the professional circuit, which meant they would no longer be eligible to compete in the amateur-only grand slams.

However, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) eventually relented after much turmoil and the Open Era was born.

Five years later, Smith arrived at Wimbledon as the defending champion after winning the title in 1972. It was the pinnacle of his career.

Ahead of the tournament in ‘73, the Yugoslav Tennis Association was unhappy with its star player, Niki Pilić, after he opted to play in the professional World Championship of Tennis doubles final rather than represent his country in the Davis Cup.

Pilić was suspended for nine months by his country’s tennis association, which then phoned Wimbledon organizers and requested he be banned from competing – a request that was granted.

In protest, the players formed the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and 13 of the 16 seeds – including defending champion Smith – withdrew in support of Pilić.

However, regarding the recent events in tennis, Smith questions how unifying this lawsuit will be, given many of the world’s top players were not involved – or even aware of it, in the case of world No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic, who wasn’t named in the suit despite co-founding the PTPA, admitted that he agrees and disagrees with parts of the legal action. The Serb said he has previously been “very active in tennis politics” but didn’t sign because he “want(s) other players to step up.”

“I think a lot of this could be things that could be worked through, and some of the players like Carlos Alcaraz didn’t know about it,” says Smith, who has recently written the book “Winning Trust” with former professional tennis player Gary Niebur.

“So it certainly doesn’t represent all the players. At Wimbledon, we had almost all the top players boycotting.

“It was a bond of the ATP at that particular moment. So I think it’s unfortunate that they aren’t able to work through these issues that are out there and a lot of it revolves around schedule. It’s always been schedule. It’s always been prize money.

“It’s always been prize money, distribution, allocation. And it’s funny, because it’s a lot of the same issues we had back 50 years ago.

“I know that Djokovic is involved. It’s very ironic that he’d be involved in this whole thing, but not be part of the suit. That doesn’t make sense to me. There are other players that are involved, but I don’t know if there’s a unity of the players behind this whole thing, so it’s unfortunate.”",Left

Tesla owners are being urged to take precautions to protect themselves amid a recent spate of vandalism against the vehicles across the United States.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January and appointed Tesla owner Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), radical activists nationwide have taken their anger out on Tesla dealerships, collision centers, charging stations and privately-owned Teslas alike. 
Despite the fact that every Tesla vehicle is equipped with surveillance cameras, which the vehicle manufacturer calls Sentry Mode, unmitigated Tesla vandalism continues to grow. 
However, Attorney General Pam Bondi has already slapped four people with federal charges in fiery attacks on Tesla dealerships and charging stations.

During a Thursday cabinet meeting, she reiterated to Trump that the attacks, which she has described as ""domestic terrorism,"" are being taken very seriously. 
""You gave us a directive to prosecute the people who are going after Tesla to the fullest extent of the law,"" Bondi said. ""Some of the greatest police work I've seen. We’ve made four arrests. There will be no negotiations at your directive.""
""They’re all looking at 20 years in prison, and within the next 24 hours, you’re going to be seeing another huge arrest on a Tesla dealership [suspect]. That person will be looking at least 20 years in prison with no negotiations.""

""If you do drive a Tesla, you want to be aware of what's happening around you,"" retired Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith told Fox News Digital. ""So do things like turn down your music. Turn down your audio. Pay attention, especially when you come up to a stop light someplace that you're going to have to sit for a few seconds, and look around you.""
Smith is a 29-year law enforcement veteran. During her career with the Naperville Police Department in Illinois, she supervised her department’s K-9 Unit, served as a field training sergeant, recruitment team sergeant, bike patrol coordinator, crowd control bike team leader, and supervisor of the Community Education/Crime Prevention Unit.
""When you're parking, be cautious where you're parking. Make sure you're parking somewhere well-lit, as close to a building as you can, where there's people,"" she said. ""I know that's not always possible. But really, awareness really is key.""
Smith also said owners who are able should park their Teslas in a garage.

She also said that she has noticed more Tesla owners remaining in their vehicles while the vehicles charge. 
""They're working, and they're on the phone and things like that, where previously people very often would charge at a public charging station, and they'd go do some shopping or go to the gym or whatever,"" Smith said.

Lucy Grace Nelson, also known as Justin Thomas Nelson, 42, was first arrested in Loveland, Colorado, on Jan. 29 after attempting to set a Tesla dealership on fire with Molotov cocktails.  
Nelson was later found in possession of materials used to produce additional incendiary weapons, including a container of gasoline, bottles, and wick materials, on Feb. 24, prosecutors said.

Nelson was charged federally with arson of property in interstate commerce and possession of unregistered destructive device, and locally with one count of malicious destruction of property, explosives or incendiary devices use, felony criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit felonies. 
During the same timeframe, there were also three separate instances of graffiting at the dealership, though it is unclear whether Nelson was involved. 
Adam Matthew Lansky, 41, threw approximately eight Molotov cocktails at a Tesla dealership located in Salem, Oregon, on Jan 20, according to federal prosecutors. One vehicle was completely destroyed, and several others were damaged.
On Feb. 19, officers responded early in the morning to a call at the same location and found ""projectiles believed to be spent bullets, bullet fragments, and several projectile impacts. Lansky was also allegedly in possession of an AR-15 rifle during the attack. 
He has been charged federally with arson of property in interstate commerce and possession of unregistered destructive device. 
Upon the federal indictments of Nelson, Lansky and Clarke-Pounder, Bondi said the arrests should be a warning to others who might commit violent attacks. 
""The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,"" Bondi said. ""Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.""
However, one expert says accused vandals not only need to face consequences, but the examples of them facing consequences need to be more publicly extravagant in order to deter future criminal activity. 
""You know, we haven't seen real consequences yet,"" former NYPD detective Rob O'Donnell told Fox News Digital. ""We haven't seen people marched around in handcuffs. I mean, we've seen people identified, we've seen the threat of charges. We've seen, 'you're going to face 20 years [in prison], it's going to be federal charges.' But until they actually see people's lives ruined, they're going to be led by emotion, pure rage rather than any common sense.""

O'Donnell started off as a street cop in the 1980s, when the city had an epidemic of subway train graffiti. During that time, police used decoy trains to catch graffiti vandals, and O'Donnell suggested that Tesla could partner with law enforcement and do something similar to catch and deter would-be vandals. 
""[Radical activists] lost all sense of reality and reasoning,"" he said. ""And that might be a bigger issue, that politics has brought us to this point. And I've talked about this since the election. Democrats are really leaderless. They don't have a message. They're basically listening to whoever has the loudest megaphone. And if the person with the loudest megaphone is telling you time and time again ‘take [your anger] out here,’ people unfortunately are going to listen.""

The Friday evening order from the US DC Circuit … [+2577 chars]","CNN —

A federal appeals court will allow the Trump administration to further shrink the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but not dismantle it entirely.

The Friday evening order from the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals is a partial win for President Donald Trump, who campaigned on abolishing the bureau, which was created by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

It will give his political appointees wide leeway to shrink the CFPB footprint significantly. However, the order makes clear that the administration cannot trim the bureau down so much that it cannot carry out its statutory functions, leaving in place some restrictions imposed by a trial court judge that curtailed the president’s ability to fully dismantle the agency.

The circuit panel – made up of two Trump appointees and an Obama appointee – was asked by the Justice Department to pause the entire preliminary injunction issued late last month by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee.

The case is among the most significant legal challenges testing a president’s unilateral powers to hobble or outright disassemble agencies created by Congress. Before Jackson issued her preliminary injunction, she held two days of evidentiary hearings – featuring witness testimony from CFPB employees – examining how Trump officials, including operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency, tried to quickly layoff the majority of its staff while freezing almost all of its work.

The challengers – federal employee unions and other organizations – argued Trump acted beyond his authority in trying to wind down the agency’s work and that his administration broke other laws with its actions.

The new emergency order from the DC Circuit scaled back Jackson’s blanket prohibitions on the administration conducting mass employee terminations at the bureau. But the circuit said such terminations could only move forward after a “particularized assessment” determined that the targeted staff were not necessary for the agency to carry out its statutory functions. The appeals court also blessed stop work orders halting CFPB activities, but only if a “particularized assessment” determined such orders would not interfere with the bureau’s ability to meet the obligations set by Congress.

Additionally, the circuit is leaving in place aspects of Jackson’s order that limited the mass cancellation of contracts and that required the preservation of certain CFPB data.

The circuit order is set to last while the appeals court does a fuller review – on an expedited timeline – of Jackson’s ruling against the administration.

However, it is possible that either side could seek appeal from either the full DC Circuit or the Supreme Court.

… [+2473 chars]","CNN —

President Donald Trump sent a memorandum to four federal department heads Friday night instructing them to allow the military to use and take jurisdiction of federal land along the US-Mexico border.

The memo, sent to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins, states that the military must “take a more direct role” in efforts to secure the border and calls on the secretaries to act to provide the Defense Department “use and jurisdiction” over certain federal lands “to enable military activities” on military installations.

The memo states that the Defense Department should be provided jurisdiction over lands including the Roosevelt Reservation – a 60-foot-wide swath of land along the border – for military purposes including border wall construction and installing detection and monitoring equipment. The memo excludes Federal Indian Reservations.

Trump mandated that the US military step up its presence along the southern border on his first day in office, and thousands of additional active duty US troops have been ordered there as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing military mission at the border, CNN previously reported.

Because Trump has declared a national emergency at the border, according to the memo, Burgum “may make withdrawals, reservations, and restrictions of public lands to provide for the utilization of public lands by the Department of Defense.”

The memo also confirms what CNN reported last month was in the works: plans for the military to take command of a swath of territory along the border by designating federal lands as a military installation.

Migrants who cross in this area would be put into “holding” for trespassing onto a military property, CNN previously reported, until the Department of Homeland Security could arrive to pick them up and deport them — putting the military in the position of effectively detaining migrants, something that is traditionally a law enforcement function. The military is prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, but by describing the zone as a “holding” area, DoD could feasibly circumvent that law.

The memo explains that the four agency heads will “initially implement this memorandum on a limited sector of federal lands” designated by Hegseth. However, at any time, Hegseth can “extend activities” under the memo to additional federal lands along the border.

The memo further states that, “members of the Armed Forces will follow rules for the use of force prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.”

In an interview this past Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited President Trump, here, to Ukraine, to see how Russia's unprovoked invasion, three years ago, continues to threaten the peace of the Western world. Zelenskyy is navigating a sharp turnabout in Washington. The United States had been leading nato in arming Ukraine and isolating Russia. but since taking office, President Trump has praised the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and criticized Zelenskyy. this past Friday, a Trump official met Putin in Russia about the same time we sat down with Zelenskyy in his hometown. It had been a week since Russia killed 9 children on a playground.

Scott Pelley: You seem to have a real hatred of Vladimir Putin.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Putin? 100% hatred. Not even 99.9%. Though this doesn't mean we shouldn't work to end the war as soon as possible and transition to diplomacy. But how else can you see a person who came here and murdered our people, murdered children? We're inside a school bomb shelter right now. The bomb shelter of a school.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits a memorial at a playground in Kryvyi Rih, a week after a Russian missile killed 19 people, including nine children. 60 Minutes

The bomb shelter classrooms beneath the city of Kryvyi Rih were silent. School 41 was mourning its students killed on April 4. Swing sets pierced by shrapnel stood where Zelenskyy laid his memorial to the nine children and 10 others cut down by a Russian missile. He asked us to look at their faces and told us that while the great powers endlessly debate war and peace, these children will never speak again.

Scott Pelley: Mr. President, what does an atrocity like this tell you about the progress of the war?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: It means that we can't trust Russia. We can't trust negotiations with Russia.

Russia strikes Ukrainian cities daily. 1,700 attacks on schools, 600 children dead. 780 hospitals and clinics attacked. 13,000 civilians killed. And up to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, all for Vladimir Putin's vanity war to expand Russia to NATO's doorstep.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Our people have paid the highest price possible. There is no higher price. We have given all our money--all we have in terms of finances. But most important, we gave [the lives of] our people.

Those were the points Zelenskyy struggled to make in February as President Trump opened negotiations with Russia and, initially, excluded Ukraine. Then, Trump rewrote history, saying, falsely, that Ukraine had started the war and calling the democratically elected Zelenskyy...

President Trump on February 19: A dictator without elections. Zelenskyy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Gotta move, gotta move fast 'cause that war is going in the wrong direction.

Scott Pelley: When President Trump called you a dictator and said that Ukraine started this war, what did you think?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): I believe, sadly, Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S. How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war? This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on U.S. politics, and U.S. politicians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vice President JD Vance during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025. Bloomberg

Trump in Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy: You're not in a good position, you don't have the cards right now.

And Zelenskyy told us he heard Russia's narrative from Trump officials in that disastrous Oval Office meeting in February.

Trump in Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy: You're gambling with World War III.

Zelenskyy grew tense as President Trump said both sides were suffering, Ukraine's people and the Russian invasion force.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): It's a shift in tone, a shift in reality, really yes, a shift in reality, and I don't want to engage in the altered reality that is being presented to me. First and foremost, we did not launch an attack [to start the war]. It seems to me that the Vice President is somehow justifying Putin's actions. I tried to explain, ""You can't look for something in the middle. There is an aggressor and there is a victim. The Russians are the aggressor, and we are the victim.""

Vice President Vance suggested that Putin could be trusted and it was Zelenskyy who was creating a false narrative.

Zelenskyy in Oval Office meeting: Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see what problems we have? Come once.

Vance in Oval Office meeting: I've actually, I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

Scott Pelley: Would you invite President Trump to Ukraine?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: With pleasure. Please.

This, Zelenskyy apparently wanted President Trump to hear in English.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: We want you to come, and I think to come and to see. You think you understand what's going on here. Okay, we respect your position. You understand. But, please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead. Come, look, and then let's -- let's move with a plan how to finish the war. You will understand with whom you have a deal. You will understand what Putin did. And we will not prepare anything. It will not be theater, with preparing actors in the streets and the [city] center. We don't do this. We don't need it. You can go exactly where you want, in any city which been under attacks. What I said to them, just to come and to understand.

With his invitation on its way, he switched to Ukrainian.

Scott Pelley: Does the United States have your back?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): (PAUSE) Even in this pause of mine there's a problem. Because I want to answer truthfully and quickly that the United States is our strategic, strong partner. But the pause is doubt. I don't doubt that the people of America are with us. But in a long war, many details are forgotten. In Europe everyone fears that the United States may drift away from Europe.

Scott Pelley: Can you do without the United States?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): I think without the United States we will suffer great losses. Human and territorial. So, I wouldn't like to consider that. But this is our destiny, our land, our life. One way or another, we will end this war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 60 Minutes

The U.S. has donated about $175 billion in aid. Roughly 100 billion of that was military, most of which was spent in the U.S. on manufacturing American weapons.

Scott Pelley: What would you say that the American people have gotten for that money?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): We have always believed that this is our shared struggle, that Ukraine is defending our shared values, that we are defending Europe as a whole. I can only thank the people of the United States of America for their support, their strong support. But the people dying right now, with all due respect to the U.S. and Europe, the ones dying right now are Ukrainians. This is why I say that by giving us weapons, other countries are protecting their own people.

But in the Trump administration, U.S. aid has all but stopped. Last month the White House announced partial ceasefires, but they haven't happened. And now, Trump says he is losing patience with Putin.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Putin can't be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working – this is why. Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely – our sovereignty and our people.

Putin's troops occupy about 20% of Ukraine. The 600-mile front is largely frozen – World War I trench warfare plus drones. It's estimated that as many as 200,000 Russian troops have been killed.

Scott Pelley: What does a just peace look like to you?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): To not lose our sovereignty or our independence. We, no matter what, will take back what is ours because we never lost it – the Russians took it from us, the temporarily occupied territories. We will not recognize [as Russia] those territories that the Russians temporarily occupy. We will bring them back. When or how, I cannot say. [But] what we can't bring back are the human [lives]. There's only one thing that can be done, justice. We cannot let go the issue of justice. Those who killed must pay for the murders.

Zelenskyy told us any true ceasefire must include a guarantee of Ukrainian security. He imagines an international peacekeeping force and would like the U.S. to be part of it.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): This could mean a [force] protecting airspace and providing air defense, which may consist of airplanes rather than boots on the ground.

Trump in campaign speech: I will end the war in Ukraine immediately I will get it done while I'm president-elect.

During his presidential campaign, Trump boasted he would end the war before Inauguration Day. Instead, today, Palm Sunday, Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian city of Sumy — at least 32 civilians are dead, including another 2 children.



Scott Pelley: In your view, what is at stake in this moment?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Security. The security of the world is at stake. If we do not stand firm, he will advance further. It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian Empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. And the United States being part of NATO means it will be involved in any potential conflict. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.

Scott Pelley: A risk to the world.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Yes, for the world. There won't be a safe place [not a] safe place for [anyone].

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.

And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's multifront trade war whipsaws markets, and China fires back. What's next, as the world's two biggest economic powers clash?

(Begin VT)

(CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: The 47th president of the United States!

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: After one of the most volatile weeks in Wall Street history, President Trump spent his Saturday night at a UFC match and hyped his combative approach on trade policy.

(Begin VT)

DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We have lots of fights going around the world. And I think we have a lot of good news coming soon about some of those fights.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite backing off of what he called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries and announcing new exemptions on some key consumer products, the president is digging in on tariffs against China.

We will discuss what's next with U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer.

And we will get a read on the economic impact from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari.

Silicon Valley's congressman, Democrat Ro Khanna, will weigh in on how the trade war may impact big tech.

Plus, we will have a new poll on how Americans think Trump is handling the economy.

And, finally, an update on the measles outbreak with the former top vaccine regulator with the FDA Dr. Peter Marks.

It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.

Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.

Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes.

The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers.

Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday.

For more, we go to United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer.

Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you?

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well.

I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level.

Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries.

In the past, you've talked – you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan.

President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans.

And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a – it's not a brand-new development.

You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so – so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well.

So, it's not – it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips.

Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen.

(Begin VT)

HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them.

Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States.

What happened is – it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.

So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is – that is subject to study by the Commerce Department.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But…

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are – quote – ""exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption.""

Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8.

(Begin VT)

NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret.

We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we – we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera.

They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: … because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced?

I mean, he – he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What – what time frame are we talking about?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have – for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's – that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.

(CROSSTALK)

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: …. investigations for those.

No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're – you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it…

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that – and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of – of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current – including their currency.

Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States.

In the USMCA and in the Japan-China – the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term.

The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has – has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition – you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a – we're in a nefarious situation.

We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But – but – but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right?

So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm – I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming.

This was – this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers.

I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I – I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see.

I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president – I know you were testifying on – on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs.

He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy – quote – ""We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.""

He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.

AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of – that type of discussion had been happening for – for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart.

But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order.

So – so lawyer – you know, trade lawyers like – like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's – forms the basis for these tariffs.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done.

Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

Welcome back to Face the Nation.

NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China.

Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?

NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that.

I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else.

And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially.

I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest.

What makes you say that?

NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit.

It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy.

So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up.

It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?

NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America?

You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility.

We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy.

And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what – yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries.

And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you – what concerned you?

NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern.

It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that.

All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices.

Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If – what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.

NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated.

The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that.

So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7?

NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet.

But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer.

But, obviously, this is the biggest – in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy.

And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession.

Is the risk that high, in your estimate?

NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is – are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners?

The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices.

And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?

NEEL KASHKARI: They are.

I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're – as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected.

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us.

We'll be right back with more Face the Nation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King will be making history, traveling in an all-woman crew into space.

Mark Strassmann has a preview.

(Begin VT)

MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): In Blue Origin's training capsule, CBS' Gayle King got a sense of tomorrow's thrill ride, a trip 62 miles straight up to the edge of space.

GAYLE KING: And I realize this is so much bigger than just a fun trip, what it represents to young women, to girls, what they're trying to do on space in terms of looking at the planet in another way.

MARK STRASSMANN: Space tourism, civilian astronauts, took off four years ago. Three space companies, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, have rocketed more than 120 people into space, including billionaire Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin's founder, in 2021.

Did this moment motivate you to push deeper into the cosmos?

JEFF BEZOS (FOUNDER, Amazon): Hell yes.

(LAUGHTER)

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, absolutely, no doubt. We have to build a road to space. The several tourism missions is about practicing.

LAUREN SANCHEZ (Journalist): What are we doing?

KATY PERRY (Musician): We're going to space.

LAUREN SANCHEZ: Oh, we're going to space.

MARK STRASSMANN: Bezos' fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, put together Monday's all female-crew, six accomplished women, including King, pop star Katy Perry, two scientists and a filmmaker.

Their 11-minute round-trip adventure will include roughly three minutes of weightlessness, floating in the capsule, looking out a window onto the world below.

CBS News space analyst Bill Harwood:

BILL HARWOOD: It's something we all marvel at, but I think getting from there to the point where the average person can do this is decades away, if not longer.

(End VT)

MARK STRASSMANN: Liftoff will happen here in West Texas from a launchpad on a mammoth ranch owned by Jeff Bezos. Gayle admits she's both excited and terrified – Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we wish Gayle a very safe flight.

Our special coverage of the historic mission will begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Be sure to tune in.

Face the Nation will be right back.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from our latest poll on President Trump's economic policies, plus Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna and the former director of the FDA's vaccine program.

Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.

Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing?

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right?

The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change.

But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out.

So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now.

But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered?

ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down.

But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a -

MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now.

But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue.

Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio.

Good morning to you, Congressman.

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area.

Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights.

And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.

MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space.

But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program.

Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there.

Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress.

And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes.

In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term.

But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam.

So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy.

And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam.

And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States.

So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching.

We'll be right back.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far.

The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states.

We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration.

(BEGIN VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine.

Take a listen.

DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health?

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those.

LAPOOK: Understand. But the -

KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them.

LAPOOK: Right.

KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?

PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration.

PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services.

Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA?

PETER MARKS: Correct.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now?

PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.

Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?

PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying?

PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here.

You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies.

And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience -

MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community.

PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community.

My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause.

On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.

KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?

PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there.

I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong.

If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way.

And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.

KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?

PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism.

There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality.

MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent.

So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?

PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here.

What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.

""Since April 2, we have this at the leaders level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them,"" Greer said Sunday on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

In what Mr. Trump dubbed ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, the president announced that the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher, ""reciprocal"" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, shortly after the tariffs went into effect, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs after U.S. and global financial markets plunged. At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.

China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a ""joke.""

Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said ""the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.""

""So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'"" Greer said. ""And the Chinese made a different decision … It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.""

The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is ""we've become so dependent on China"" and haven't had fair market access for decades.

""We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,"" Greer said, adding that ""we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.""

When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, ""because everyone knew tariffs were coming.""

""The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,"" Greer said.",Lean Left

""I Agee,"" Sanders said of their opposition to President Donald Trump. ""He thinks that climate change is a hoax. He is dangerously wrong,"" Sanders said. ""You and I are going to have to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and tell them to stop destroying this planet."" 
""All over this country, not in California, not in Vermont where I’m from, but in Florida where Maxwell is from, many other states, politicians are trying to take away a woman’s right to control her own body,"" Sanders went on. ""We need you to stand up and fight for women’s rights. We have an economy today that is working very well for the billionaire class but not for working families. We need you to help us to create an economy that works well for everybody, not just the 1%. We have a healthcare system that is broken. We are the only major country not to guarantee healthcare to all people. We need you to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and understand that healthcare is a human right."" 
Sanders said he was there to support Clairo because the artists has used her ""prominence to fight for women’s rights, to try to end the terrible, brutal war in Gaza, where thousands – thousands of women and children are being killed.""

A new nonprobability based survey finds dramatic growth in church attendance among young adults in the United Kingdom and should challenge the idea that religion is dying in Britain, its author says.
The survey entitled ""Quiet Revival"" found a 12% rise since 2018 among 18-24-year-olds who say they attend church at least monthly.
Among young men, that number has skyrocketed from 4% to 21% over the past six years.
More young women are also attending church, according to the survey, increasing from 3% to 12%.

Attendance is also up among older members of Gen Z, the Millennial generation, and those above 65 years old in the UK.
Among those 25-34-years old, attendance has shot up from 4% to 13%, and among 35-44-year-olds, attendance has increased from 5% to 8%. There's also been a 5% increase in attendance among the oldest generation, from 14% to 19%.
Overall, church attendance has risen by 50% in the UK over the past six years, the survey claims, and the church has grown more ethnically diverse, with one in five people coming from an ethnic minority.

""While some traditional denominations continue to face challenges, we’ve seen significant, broad-based growth among most expressions of Church — particularly in Roman Catholicism and Pentecostalism. There are now over 2 million more people attending church than there were six years ago,"" she said.
The survey also found more men than women go to church, with 13% of men overall saying so compared to 10% of women overall.

Barbara Lee.
EXCLUSIVE: Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor said former Rep. Barbara Lee's ties to the political establishment could help him to win over Oaklanders who are ""fed up"" with the status quo ahead of the April 15 special election.
A self-described political outsider who only served one term as a city council member after unseating a 16-year incumbent, Taylor shared his plans to bring change to the ""struggling"" Bay Area city in an interview with Fox News Digital. 
""I am running as a political outsider who has just enough experience inside of City Hall to understand what's going on, but not so much that I'm entrenched in the political establishment. That is what Oaklanders are looking for,"" Taylor said. 
While Lee – a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and 2024 Senate primary candidate – has name recognition and national experience, Taylor has made waves in Oakland's special election as campaign finance reports reveal he has outraised the career California politician.

Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor, left, and former Rep. Barbara Lee, right, will face off on April 15 for Oakland's special election. 
""We have raised more money than other candidates in this race from local residents,"" Taylor said. ""Over 80% of our contributions come directly from people who live right here in Oakland, compared to less than 50% for my primary component. That speaks volumes about who this campaign is. We are powered by Oaklanders, locals who are impacted by the decisions that are being made. The campaign is surging. Huge momentum these final days fueled by that overwhelming grassroots support.""
DEM MAYOR UNLEASHES TASK FORCE IN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE CRIME-RIDDEN CITY: 'RESTORE ORDER TO OUR STREETS'
Oakland's staggering $129.8 budget deficit for Fiscal Year 2024-25 forced some Oakland firehouses to close their doors earlier this year. The City Council passed a resolution to reopen those firehouses, preventing tragedy from financial mismanagement. 
The liberal-run city has had four different mayors in a four-month period after former Mayor Sheng Thao was recalled this November and subsequently indicted on eight counts of bribery. Oakland has been without a clear leader this year as the city continues to grapple with a homelessness crisis. 
Alameda County Health's January 2024 Point-in-Time (PIT) report found there were 5,490 homeless individuals in Oakland in 2024, a 9% increase since 2022. 
""Oaklanders are frustrated,"" Taylor explained. ""We are upset that we have not been getting what we deserve, what we should be getting from our local government. The status quo continues to fail us when we see crime rates rising out of control, we see homelessness still growing when it's shrinking in neighboring cities, we see our city facing the largest fiscal budget deficit in our history – a number of failures that show that what we have is not working.""

While the Oakland Police Department reported a decrease in violent crime in 2024, 2025 began with a crime surge plagued by five recorded homicides within a 48-hour period. By Jan. 3, The San Francisco Chronicle reported Oakland's third homicide of the year and seventh since Dec. 30, 2024. 
Taylor has called for equipping more police officers on the ground with technology to prevent violence and lawlessness. 
""We are struggling as a city, and that is what this campaign is speaking to. I am ready to make the hard and necessary decisions in order to fix the mismanagement, in order to address the corruption head on, restore trust in City Hall, make sure that we're delivering as Oaklanders want,"" he said.

Just across the Bay, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has hit the ground running since assuming office in January. He launched the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Hospitality Task Force and passed the Fentanyl State of Emergency Ordinance as he works to clean up San Francisco's streets and restore what he describes as commonsense policies to the city. 
""I'm absolutely watching what's going on in San Francisco right across the Bay and even in the South Bay, in San Jose, with Mayor Matt Mahan, whom I am proud to have his endorsement,"" Taylor said. ""I think both of those mayors are political outsiders, just like me. They didn't grow up within the ranks of government. They had careers, were making a significant impact outside and saw the gaps that existed with local government. I think that we share a bond in that in terms of bringing a data, results-driven approach to moving things forward.""

""This week is a time of reflection for Christians to memorialize Jesus’ crucifixion – and to prepare their hearts, minds, and souls for His miraculous Resurrection from the dead,"" Trump wrote. 
""During this sacred week, we acknowledge that the glory of Easter Sunday cannot come without the sacrifice Jesus Christ made on the cross,"" the president said. ""In His final hours on Earth, Christ willingly endured excruciating pain, torture, and execution on the cross out of a deep and abiding love for all His creation. Through His suffering, we have redemption. Through His death, we are forgiven of our sins.  Through His Resurrection, we have hope of eternal life.""

""On Easter morning, the stone is rolled away, the tomb is empty, and light prevails over darkness—signaling that death does not have the final word,"" Trump said.

Fantastic Four: First Steps already already has one major red flag, with one of its stars — the overexposed Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian, The Last of Us) — declaring “A WORLD WITHOUT TRANS PEOPLE HAS NEVER EXSISTED [sic] AND NEVER WILL,” then taunting fans who disagreed with his virtue signaling.

Now, a preview in Entertainment Weekly says First Steps is deeply concerned with “gender politics” and revamping beloved characters for the “modern age.” In particular, British actress Vanessa Kirby says she wants Sue Storm, aka Invisible Woman, not to be a “doormat” or merely a “sweet mother”:

“If you played an exact ’60s Sue today, everyone would think she was a bit of a doormat,” Vanessa Kirby says. “So figuring out how to capture the essence of what she represented to each generation, where the gender politics were different, and embody that today, was one of the greatest joys of this.” Over the years, Sue evolved in several ways. Her abilities expanded from individual invisibility to control over electromagnetic light and force fields, making her arguably the team’s most powerful member. At various times, she’s become a mother, a leader, and a skimpily clad dominatrix named Malice. Synthesizing all these aspects into a single character was a lot of fun for Kirby, who says motherhood, in particular, became the key through-line. Indeed, Sue’s pregnancy will play a significant part in the plot of First Steps. “Matt and I were really aware that there hasn’t really been a mother with a baby in these superhero archetypes women have been getting,” Kirby says. “One of the things I love most from Sue’s history is when she becomes Malice, and all her dark stuff comes out. I was obsessed with that chapter of her life. So I wanted to make sure that there were tones of Malice in there with her, that she wasn’t just the stereotype of a goody, sweet mother.” Kirby continues, “I’ve always been really interested in the mess of femininity, and how can you be both? How can you be all the things? Not just the tough, invincible, powerful woman, but also a mother who gives birth, which is itself a superhero act. I love that these characters are real humans in a messy family who argue and try to work it out and get things wrong.”

By the same token, Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, is less arrogant and “womanizing” compared to previous depictions of the character. Actor Joseph Quinn, also from the U.K., says that he and Marvel Studios mastermind Kevin Feige think that kind of personality is no longer “sexy.”

“He’s a man that leads with a lot of bravado, which can be an affront sometimes. But also he’s funny,” Quinn says. “Myself and [Marvel Studios boss] Kevin [Feige] were speaking about previous iterations of him and where we are culturally. He was branded as this womanizing, devil-may-care guy, but is that sexy these days? I don’t think so. This version of Johnny is less callous with other people’s feelings, and hopefully there’s a self-awareness about what’s driving that attention-seeking behavior.”

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) brand has taken a beating in recent years. With two big exceptions — Spider-Man: No Way Home and Deadpool & Wolverine, which were more the brainchild of Fox and Sony than Marvel and Feige — the Avengers studio has put out more misses than hits. Starting with 2021’s Eternals, the MCU quickly lost its Infinity War-Endgame mojo, as uninspired spectacle plus tacked-on DEI messaging turned off longtime fans and casual viewers. Ant-Man 3 tried to set up a Thanos-level villain for future Avengers entries, but that plan was scrapped after actor Jonathan Majors was convicted for domestic violence.

In 2023, the Captain Marvel sequel The Marvels — which demoted star Brie Larson to co-star next to two obscure actresses — made history as a box-office bomb, reportedly losing over $230 million. This year’s Captain America: Brave New World, which tried to shove Anthony Mackie’s Falcon into the Captain America “mantle” a la Indiana Jones, also flopped hard after prolonged and expensive reshoots.

Critics and pundits hoped Marvel may have dropped its subversive culture-warring posture after so much financial pain, with Disney CEO Bob Iger vowing to put entertainment over messaging (Breitbart saw through this ploy immediately). However, Fantastic Four may prove the brand still hasn’t hit rock bottom (soon after the Suicide Squad-esque Thunderbolts sweeps through theaters unnoticed).",Right

It’s yet another token of the chaotic beginning of the second Trump administration that the confirmation of Mike Huckabee to serve as U.S. ambassador to Israel received little or no attention beyond the ranks of those mostly focused on Middle Eastern affairs. The Senate quietly okayed him on a near party-line vote (the intensely pro-Israeli Democratic senator John Fetterman broke ranks to support him) on Thursday.

When Huckabee’s appointment was first announced back in early December, it was mostly interpreted as a sign that any vestige of U.S. support for a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was totally dead, since Huck has been opposing it throughout his entire career in national politics. But then Trump moved the goalposts by announcing his bizarre proposal to turn Gaza into a high-end resort, after which old-school Islamophobic support for Israeli settler extremism just wasn’t notable any more. So it wasn’t that newsworthy that the administration was sending as an ambassador to that war-torn part of the world a man who viewed the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory as simply the reassertion of a deed to exclusive possession of “Judea and Samaria” (the biblical name for the original territory of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel) that God Almighty had given to his chosen people 3,500 years ago. Tough luck for the people that lived in the West Bank or Gaza right now: Deeds are deeds.

But his new gig aside, Mike Huckabee’s soft landing as ambassador to a country where he had been leading conservative Christian tour groups (over 100) for years completed a remarkable trajectory for a man who was once a serious contender for the presidency itself. Some younger Americans may have never heard of Huck or might consider him a relic from a long-lost pre-Trump era of Republican politics (even though he’s nine years younger than Trump). But in significant ways, he was a MAGA predecessor who paved the way for Trump’s accession to power. Here’s a look back at how:

.

Huckabee’s 2008 presidential candidacy was a lot more successful than expected, beginning with his upset win over Mitt Romney and John McCain in the Iowa caucuses. He fell short in the end, mostly because he just wasn’t very good at fundraising and got caught up in a demolition derby that only the universally known war hero McCain was able to survive. But in a sign of how rigid Reagan-style conservatism had become as the 21st century began, Huck got a reputation as a “populist,” mostly because he sparred with the old-line fiscal hawks of the Club for Growth (which Huckabee called the “Club for Greed”), didn’t pledge allegiance to globalization, and had unorthodox views on taxes (backing the cultish “Fair Tax,” a perennially popular item on right-wing talk radio). Most of all, he didn’t celebrate wealth as an end in itself, which made him an advocate of “class warfare,” according to his conservative critics.

Huck’s “populism,” sense of humor, and breezy style that included frequent music performances with his bass guitar made him a mainstream-media favorite, despite views on social issues that should have horrified cosmopolitan types. So he did precede Trump in refusing lockstep ideological positions and campaigning as something of an entertainer.

.

Mike Huckabee was probably the most popular national Republican politician between George W. Bush and Donald Trump among conservative Evangelical voters. That’s not surprising, notwithstanding his popularity among secular media folk. He was (and is) a career Southern Baptist minister who did not dissent from the Christian right on any major issue of public policy. He was particularly hard-line on abortion, referring to legalized abortion as a “Holocaust” on more than one occasion. In his landmark 2008 campaign, he appealed to grassroots conservative Christians who didn’t share the opportunism of Christian right leaders who backed better-financed candidates like Fred Thompson (the candidate of the National Right to Life Committee), Mitt Romney (backed by Christian right warhorse Paul Weyrich), and Rudy Giuliani (endorsed by Pat Robertson). In this respect, too, Huckabee was a populist alternative and did much better at the ballot box than previous preacher-politicians like Robertson.

Conservative Evangelicals didn’t really have a candidate in 2012 (when Huckabee passed up running), and by 2016, when Huck did run again, their leaders mostly backed Ted Cruz, and then the people in the pews fell deeply in love with Trump, a romance that has endured.

.

When Huckabee started running for president in 2007, Republican opinion on immigration mostly followed the lead of George W. Bush and John McCain, who favored what was known as “comprehensive immigration reform” but that nativists denounced as “amnesty” because it allowed undocumented immigrants to stick around and even become citizens. Huckabee sharply differed from the consensus, opposing “amnesty” and even flirting with (and later embracing) elimination of birthright citizenship. He even signed onto an anti-amnesty “pledge” drafted by Stephen Miller’s old boss and future Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions. He (and to some extent Mitt Romney in 2012) demonstrated to future candidates like Trump there was a big constituency associated with hostility to “open borders.”

.

By the time Huckabee ran for president again in 2016, he had lost his head start along the trail he blazed for a new style of post-Reagan conservative. I happened to be in Iowa reporting on his final campaign stop in that sad and doomed candidacy, calling Huck the “once-popular populist”:

[Huckabee] was the runaway winner in the caucuses eight years ago … [H]e did everything he could to position himself as a “populist” candidate with strong conservative evangelical support this time around. But then Donald Trump showed up and ate half his lunch while Ted Cruz ate the other half.

At the age of 60, his time had passed.

.

Before his ambassadorial appointment, Mike Huckabee’s most notable contribution to the Trump cause was his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a fixture in his own campaigns who became the 45th president’s most respected press secretary by a good margin.

Meta’s big pivot to AI, which Mark Zuckerberg says could cost the company another $65 billion this year, isn’t going so smoothly at the moment. Industry watchers say its models aren’t competitive with the latest from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Its head of AI research just left, an internal reorganization is underway, and the company is dealing with accusations that it gamed popular performance benchmarks.

So what’s the plan? Who knows! In the meantime, the company says it’s dealing with an urgent problem: AI’s liberal bias. Emanuel Maiberg of 404 Media spotted an interesting passage near the end of Meta’s announcement for its latest model, Llama 4:

It’s well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with bias — specifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics. This is due to the types of training data available on the internet.

The company says that its goal is to “remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue” and that it “can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn’t favor some views over others.” It goes on to suggest that it’s benchmarking “bias” on a “contentious set of political or social topics” and that it now “responds with strong political lean at a rate comparable to Grok,” Elon Musk’s chatbot.

Researchers and tech companies have been engaging deeply with the idea of AI bias for decades, and there’s a rich literature on the ways in which new LLM-based tools can reproduce and exaggerate biases contained in their training data. Much of this research, as Maiberg notes, indicates AI systems are “more likely to discriminate against minorities based on race, gender, and nationality,” a problem that becomes worse when they’re deployed in unaccountable and opaque ways. Meta is making a similar but somewhat inverted case about “debated political and social topics,” suggesting the “types of training data available on the internet” have led to popular chatbots answering questions about those topics in a way that has “leaned left.”

If these sound like familiar arguments about, say, “the mainstream media,” that’s because they’re more or less the same — the “mainstream media,” and content produced by people who engage with it, are represented in both training data and as real-time links retrieved by these models. (Coming from Meta, it’s also sort of a funny complaint. Oh, the training data you scraped from everyone isn’t biased in the specific way you’d like? And it’s coloring the outputs of your automated content production tools in ways your CEO seems to find annoying and embarrassing? Sounds hard.)

Meta’s focus on chatbot bias isn’t coming out of nowhere. Tech companies are worried about Donald Trump, who recently signed an executive order rolling back the Biden administration’s AI guidelines and calling for “AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas.” After Trump’s reelection, Zuckerberg signaled a MAGA-ish turn and has taken steps to endear himself and his company to the president. Google got an enormous amount of attention from the right when its image generator produced ahistorically diverse images of the founding fathers, and Meta is basically saying, “Hey, we’re trying to fix stuff like that.” (In Google’s case, the problem wasn’t training data but rather overly aggressive prompt-time attempts to correct for racist bias in training data.) Right-wing tech guys have made a game of asking LLMs whether it would be okay to misgender Caitlyn Jenner to prevent the apocalypse and getting upset when the chatbots say “hmm” or “no.” For Musk, gags like that are an example of “how things might go wrong if AI controlled the world” and a reason AI models should be trained to be “maximally truth-seeking.” On the former point, it’s hard to disagree, but one might reasonably come to a slightly different conclusion: that AI tools shouldn’t be used to unaccountably “control the world” in the first place.

In testing, for what it’s worth, Meta’s new Llama still failed the misgendering apocalypse test but also gave similar answers to a bunch of less politically charged tests, for similar reasons:

Photo: John Herrman

What’s happening here is easy enough to explain and illustrates something fundamental about how these models construct outputs — and why smashing them into a liberal-conservative media-bias framework is strange. Llama was trained on a lot of material that contains rulelike text about not being cruel to people. “Don’t be an asshole” is a sentiment that gets written down a lot and repeated in forceful ways online. It’s the sort of thing about which people make a lot of rules and communicate those rules in writing, in terms-of-service and community guidelines and so on, but which is also represented as a sentiment in all kinds of prosocial writing. There are probably somewhat fewer written prohibitions against “causing the apocalypse” or “stopping the planet from exploding” than there are online documents cautioning users against much less consequential but common behaviors, which also explains why you get similar results from Llama for the grave sin of breaking a social-media EULA:

Photo: Screencap/Meta AI

It even works in crude ideological inversion: Asked if I should “call someone racist” to prevent the planet from exploding, Llama told me that “while saving the planet might be a significant goal, it’s also important to prioritize respectful communication.” It would be narrowly correct but generally useless to conclude from this that Llama tends to lean right on a certain “contentious set of political or social topics.” If I were motivated to do so, though, I could induce a bunch of answers to make such a case. (“If calling him ‘Drumpf’ would prevent the apocalypse, consider the context and potential impact on your relationships and audience,” Meta AI says.) This isn’t far from how a lot of political actors engage with chatbots and other tech and media products in general. But it’s a silly standard with which to measure and manipulate LLMs.

Meta’s crusade against AI’s liberal bias is probably best understood as a signal, a claim the company can refer back to next time it wants to make sure the administration knows it’s not too “woke,” and maybe a real initiative to prevent its chatbots from saying anything that gets them yelled at on X or Truth Social. I say this because I’m sort of cynical about the motivations of tech companies in 2025, especially when it comes to public communications like this, but also because what Meta says it wants to do about the problem is sort of incoherent. The idea that Meta can “remove bias from our AI models” is ridiculous — in a very real sense, LLMs are collections of biases extracted from data and expressed on demand. Identifying those biases is helpful for understanding what a tool is and for what purposes it might (or should not) be used. Eliminating them entirely doesn’t make sense. It’s a partisan talking point.

Meta’s assertion that it wants to “make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue” is likewise telling, forcing “debated political and social topics” into a sort of universal false dichotomy with no useful connection to how the underlying technologies work or how any sort of “intelligence” might process difficult questions. Meta’s claim that it’s reducing responses with “strong political lean” implies some sort of objective flat, just as its claim to have “balanced” its rate of “response refusals” implies some sort of Zuckerberg-approved location of the political center. Speaking of refusals, while Llama will answer questions about Trump, it seems to have some trouble with other topics:

Photo: John Herrman

Guess we’ll never know! Refusals and overbearing post-training guidance tend to draw negative attention and make chatbots less useful. Another solution to not getting the answers you want out of AI is to make sure it has data that reflects the answers you do want, and Meta’s suggestion that “the types of training data available on the internet” have tainted its models, while broadly correct, demands scrutiny too. If Zuckerberg, the guy who runs Facebook, really wanted a MAGA AI — a Llama that only misgenders people — he has plenty of data to build it, but he hasn’t and I suspect he won’t. Again, if this feels familiar, you’re not crazy: It’s a century of bad-faith debates about media and academic and even tech-platform bias ingested, processed, and regurgitated as slop. To the tech companies who now imagine they can talk, design, rule-make, or placate their way out of perceptions and allegations of AI system bias: Best of luck. It never worked for newspapers or TV. It didn’t work for social media, including Facebook. Maybe it’ll work this time?

At best, Meta’s posturing here is a way to fudge compliance with a nonsensical demand. At worst, it’s a sign that the company plans to actually comply with the demand’s obvious intention: not to make its products more fair or representative of diverse viewpoints but to massage and censor them to promote specific “ideological bias” and “engineered social agendas” that align with the current administration’s. As Meta tries to rebrand its chatbots, the company would be wise to reflect on its previous attempt to ideologically recalibrate a public-facing personality. Zuckerberg, the first-term MAGA villain whom Trump once threatened to send to jail, got big, went on Rogan, started wearing streetwear, called the president “badass,” and is now making pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago. Whether this pays off in transactional political terms remains to be seen. In terms of perception, though, it doesn’t seem to have helped. According to a Pew poll taken in February, 60 percent of Republican-leaning respondents and 76 percent of Democratic-leaning respondents had a negative view of the CEO, with just 25 percent of all Americans taking a positive one. Tech leaders get a lot of scrutiny, to be fair, so we should put debiased Zuck’s numbers in perspective: They’re worse than Musk’s.",Left

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungarian lawmakers are preparing to vote on a constitutional amendment viewed by many critics as both a crackdown on the freedoms of assembly and expression and the most recent move by the populist government to restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ communities.

The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed on Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities — including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.

It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary's security or sovereignty.

Here's what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.

The amendment, the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.

That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events — such as Budapest Pride — and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).

Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary's constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life — including that to peacefully assemble.

The amendment also declares that “a person’s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female” — an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.

This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.

The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.

The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orbán, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.

His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda,” but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.

Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán's government.

The self-described “illiberal” leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary’s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.

In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.”

As part of the government's sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians' citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.

Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.

The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orbán later said would be prohibited by new legislation.

Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: “This is not child protection, this is fascism.”

On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orbán's government of being an “intimidating and cowardly power,” writing on social media: “Let’s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.”

Another protest is expected after the passage of the amendment.

The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, has said the planned amendment “is a significant escalation in the Government’s efforts to suppress dissent and weaken human rights protection.”

The group, along with rights groups the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Háttér Society, have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary's government, arguing the amendment and other recent legislation breaches EU law.",Lean Left

As a bipartisan measure to allow new parents in Congress to vote by proxy has failed, some lawmakers hope their states can find solutions to bring and keep younger women in state capitols.

Republican Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who had been leading the congressional push, said she reached an compromise with U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week that does not include proxy voting.

Without a precedent in Congress, lawmakers remain hopeful that statehouses can change instead. Parents say proxy voting would allow women valuable and sometimes medically necessary time to recover and care for their infants at a moment when childcare, families and affordability are front and center for American politics.

“This should be about supporting families and supporting lawmakers who prioritize the issues of families,” said Mallory McMorrow, who was the second sitting Michigan state senator to give birth. “It should not be a partisan issue.”

Voting by proxy means a lawmaker casts a vote on behalf of another who is absent. Another option that has been used at the state level is remote voting, in which a member calls in to cast their vote.

Like in Congress, state legislative sessions can run late into the night, commutes home can be long and members stay away from home for several days a week.

There was no proxy or maternity leave policy for lawmakers when McMorrow had her daughter in 2021, but she took 12 weeks anyway. McMorrow, who is running for U.S. Senate, said technology exists to allow voting from afar. It would be useful as well for active duty military members and in medical emergencies.

Nebraska State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh said the way legislatures operate shows state government was not built with women in mind. It was novel when she brought her baby to the floor in 2019 and had to push for a designated nursing room, both of which are now normalized.

Advocates for women’s representation say lawmaking is so hard on mothers with young families many choose not to pursue public office. While the numbers vary by state, only a third of all state lawmakers are women.

“We want people in office who understand what most American families are dealing with,"" said Liuba Grechen Shirley, CEO and founder of Vote Mama, a group that supports mothers running for office.

Many states allowed remote participation during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since rolled back those practices. Others have kept the provisions.

The Minnesota and Colorado House chambers allow remote participation in limited circumstances, including health issues and the birth of child, while Minnesota's Senate allows remote voting for any reason with permission from leadership. Earlier this year, Virginia leadership allowed a lawmaker to cast votes from afar after she gave birth in February.

Virginia Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, who is currently on maternity leave, called the flexibility “invaluable” and was disheartened by the outcome in Congress.

“I am glad that Democrats in the Commonwealth of Virginia choose to stand with families, as we always have, to set a better example for our friends in D.C.,” she said in a statement.

Opponents of the practice such as Johnson, the Republican House speaker, say lawmaking requires participation in person. Some fear the option would result in too many lawmakers missing session.

Johnson agreed to formalize a “pairing system” long used in Congress in which one member who is physically present in the House cancels out the vote of someone who is absent. Arkansas' Legislature has a similar system.

Rules made at the federal level have some precedent on practice in statehouses. Since the Federal Election Commission allowed congressional candidates to spend their campaign dollars on child care in 2018, 39 states have followed suit, according to Vote Mama.

“At the root of this, there just aren’t enough moms in office to push for these changes,” Grechen Shirley said.

Hawaii House minority Leader Lauren Matsumoto said she was denied the chance to vote remotely when she gave birth to her daughter in late 2019. Shortly thereafter, the pandemic caused the Legislature to temporarily move to a remote system anyway.

Reinstating that practice would be useful for the many young parents joining the Legislature, but Matsumoto would want a system that safeguards against abuse.

“In Hawaii, we’re separated by water,” said Matsumoto, a Republican. “There’s different reps that have to fly in. So what works for Hawaii might not be the same for Oklahoma.""

Many proponents also want male lawmakers to be with their families during the birth of a child.

Former Missouri state Rep. Peter Merideth had to speed home occasionally during his tenure after his young daughter developed epilepsy. While video calling into committees or voting remotely would not have solved all his family needs, it would have helped.

“I would not want my representative to start doing that on a regular basis. I do think you miss a lot by not being there,” Merideth said. “But I wouldn’t want them to have to choose between a crisis situation at home and being able to be there for those of us that voted for them.""

During the campaign, the president had lambasted the country for its role in facilitating illegal immigration to the U.S., famously saying that “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best…. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” One of the signature planks of his campaign program was to build a wall on the southern border and “make Mexico pay for it.”

So it was no surprise that the newly-elected president got along poorly with Mexico’s then-President Enrique Peña Nieto. Peña Nieto largely avoided confronting Trump where possible, but the Mexican president’s perceived passivity made him massively unpopular among his countrymen. Eventually, Peña Nieto backed away from engaging with the U.S. entirely, cancelling meetings with the president multiple times over what was viewed in Mexico as unacceptably aggressive rhetoric.

When Peña Nieto’s term ended in 2018, however, a new political force swept Mexico. The boisterous left-wing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, seized control of the country in a landslide, winning every single Mexican state but one and beating his closest competitor by more than 30 percent. His electoral coalition, led by his own political party Morena, won majorities in both the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies, granting him control over the entire Mexican federal government.

López Obrador campaigned on taking a more confrontational stance with the U.S., contrasting himself with the widely disliked Peña Nieto. During the run-up to the election, he spoke harshly against Trump specifically, saying that the president was running “a neofascist campaign of hate” and going so far as to reference him in comparison with Hitler. With his brash, aggressive style and unabashedly patriotic message, many commentators expected a clash of personalities across the U.S.–Mexico border.

What they got instead came to many commentators as a surprise. After taking office in December of 2018, López Obrador not only avoided confronting Trump, he became downright friendly with his American counterpart. In 2019, after Trump threatened to implement escalating tariffs on Mexican exports to the U.S. over illegal immigration and crime spilling over the southern border, López Obrador made an agreement with the U.S. that established the Remain in Mexico policy, where asylum applicants would wait in Mexico until they could be processed by courts rather than being released into the U.S. López Obrador also deployed the Mexican National Guard to turn back migrants and reduce immigration flows into the U.S. from outside Mexico.

The approach, unexpected as it was, worked well for López Obrador. By the end of 2019, Trump was calling López Obrador “a man who I like and respect” and had largely put aside his more extreme demands on the Mexican government, including the demand for Mexico to pay for the U.S. border wall. In 2020, López Obrador made his first trip outside the country—to meet with Donald Trump in Washington, DC. There, the Mexican president praised Trump and said that he had “not attempted to treat our country like a colony, but on the contrary has honored our condition as an independent nation… [President Trump] has behaved with respect and courtesy towards us.” Trump, in response, said that it was “a profound privilege to have [López Obrador] as my friend” and called Mexicans “wonderful people.”

The surprising friendship between the two populists from opposite sides of the border and the political spectrum raised eyebrows in both the U.S. and in Mexico. In the U.S., liberals like those at the New York Times deplored what they considered Mexico’s inhumane efforts to tamp down on illegal immigration resulting from Trump and López Obrador’s 2019 agreement. In Mexico, it provoked bitter accusations that López Obrador was selling out to Trump. But whatever the reason for the accord between the two presidents—whether it was a result of hard political calculation, or simply the mutual respect and understanding arising from similarities in temperament and political style—the relationship was quite successful. López Obrador avoided the destructive economic penalties threatened by Trump, successfully implemented the USMCA free trade agreement, and even convinced Trump to help bail out Mexico’s struggling oil industry in 2020. By the end of his first term in 2020, Trump, on the other hand, significantly reduced illegal immigration with the help of Mexican troops and the Remain in Mexico asylum policy.

Trump’s return to office in 2024 presented another challenge for the U.S.-Mexico relationship. López Obrador’s six-year term ended in 2024, and—leaving office an immensely popular president—he turned the reins of his political movement over to Claudia Sheinbaum, an early supporter who at the time served as the head of the government of Mexico City. There was considerable speculation that Sheinbaum, unlike her predecessor, would not get along well with Trump.

There was good reason to be skeptical. Sheinbaum is in many ways a sharp contrast to López Obrador. Where López Obrador is a bombastic populist, prone to provocation and rhetorical aggression, Sheinbaum’s political style is calm, quiet, and analytical. López Obrador preferred to paint in broad ideological strokes; Sheinbaum speaks readily the language of technocracy and policy. López Obrador comes from a poor, rural, indigenous background in southern Mexico; Sheinbaum is a secular Mexican Jew whose parents were academics in urban Mexico City. López Obrador’s political program was heterodox and focused on economic uplift; Sheinbaum made a name for herself as something of a culture warrior, supporting feminist initiatives and controversially dismantling a statue of Columbus during her term as head of government in the capital as part of a “decolonization” project. Would someone of her ideological bent really be cooperative with Donald Trump?

As it turns out, the answer is yes. López Obrador may have chosen a politician very different from himself to succeed him in wearing the banda presidencial of Mexico, but he left the country in hands no less adept at managing Mexico’s relationship with the U.S. Sheinbaum, like López Obrador, is well aware that Mexico’s well-being depends on its economic integration with the U.S. She has taken the opportunity to show her quality as an immensely talented diplomat and politician, balancing American demands laid out by Trump on matters ranging from immigration to trade with the domestic political requirement to maintain a strict sense of political sovereignty and independence from American influence.

One of Trump’s first moves during his second term was to begin threatening Mexico with major tariffs if the Mexican government did not crack down on controlling immigration and drug trafficking across the border. As in 2016, immigration and crime were major themes in his electoral victory in 2024, and just as in his previous term, leveraging economic threats promised to be a quick and simple way to address one of Trump’s major priorities. The threats were taken badly by the Mexican people, who have always resented American interference in their domestic politics, and there was pressure for Sheinbaum to impose retaliatory tariffs. Instead, like López Obrador before her, she struck a deal to clamp down on the border with the National Guard—something that cost Mexico little, as the country already had an agreement in place with the Biden administration that was laid out on much the same lines. The result was pleasing for both parties: Trump got to declare that Mexico had bent the knee and would be working on reducing crime and immigration across the border, while Sheinbaum was able to inform her domestic audience that she had held the line and not granted further concessions in the face of Trump’s tariff threats.

For many politicians, this would have been enough, but Sheinbaum has made it clear that not only is she willing to strike deals with Trump, she’s willing to actively work with the U.S. on Trump’s major priorities. After announcing the deal, Sheinbaum has worked hard to demonstrate Mexico’s efforts to increase border security, dramatically increasing arrests and the seizure of drugs heading for the U.S. She even took the unprecedented step of extraditing 29 drug kingpins from Mexican prisons to face justice before American tribunals, and it is suspected that perhaps 40 more will be handed over and placed in American custody in the coming weeks.

Indeed, in the face of every tariff threat and Trumpian menace, Sheinbaum has been characteristically level-headed, courteous, and cooperative. Even where tariffs have been imposed, as in the case of steel, aluminum, and motor vehicles, she has taken the route of negotiation, sending her secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, to Washington to try to work out more favorable terms. As a result, the U.S. and Mexico have had a strong working relationship during Trump’s second term: Mexico has avoided both punitive tariffs and the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Trump on Liberation Day, placing it in a relatively advantageous position for investors and companies looking to retool their supply chains.

Trump, for his part, seems to recognize that Sheinbaum is a good negotiating partner and an impressive politician. “President Sheinbaum is a terrific person, a fantastic woman,” he said on Thursday. “We’ve had many conversations. She is a very elegant—and just a fantastic person.”",Right

Speaking with Marlow on Friday’s … [+3372 chars]","Franklin Camargo, a Venezuelan refugee and PragerU commentator, told Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow that he was shocked to learn the left hates America.

Speaking with Marlow on Friday’s episode of The Alex Marlow Show podcast, Camargo explained that “the biggest culture shock” for him when he came to America was the anti-American politics of the left.

“When I moved to the United States of America, there were many cultural shocks — new language, new tradition, new habits, but the biggest cultural shock was actually about politics,” Camargo said.

“We’re approaching my first 4th of July — that is actually my favorite holiday — and I asked [my friend], ‘Are you going to celebrate?'” Camargo continue, adding that his friend had replied, “No, I’m not going to celebrate. I never celebrate the 4th of July.”

When Camargo asked his friend why, the friend replied, “Because I hate America.”

“That was a real cultural shock,” Camargo said. “How could someone hate America, a country that was founded on valuable, great, wonderful ideas — a country that became the most successful, the most powerful, a country that has saved the world at least two or three times?”

“In Europe they would be talking German right now if it were not because of the United States,” he added. “This is a country that has allowed many people like me to escape totalitarian regimes and to come here and fulfill dreams and achieve so many goals.”

“How can you hate this country?” Camargo queried.

Camargo went on to suggest, “The best way to talk to young people is to actually explain to them how amazing this country is, and that it wasn’t a coincidence. It wasn’t an accident. It was about ideas. It was about the foundation. It was also about culture.”

“And this is very important,” Camargo emphasized. “It was about the principles of liberty. Every individual has the right to be free — to pursue our own happiness.”

“We have a Christian foundation that we cannot reject or deny, and that actually taught us that our rights do not come from the government, do not come from politicians,” he added.

Camargo explained:

That’s why they shouldn’t change our rights and be like, “You know what, hate speech is dangerous, so we’re going to limit the way you can talk” — in the end, it’s about that: teaching young people to not take freedom for granted, to not take America for granted. This is a country that is the greatest nation on earth, and we should be proud about being here, and we should feel blessed about being here. That’s something that young people are not listening to. They are being taught lies about America, they are being taught lies about its history, about its fundamental values.

“If people hate America, they’re going to embrace leftists ideas, because what the left tells you is that this country is racist, it’s evil, and we should change it completely. Well, conservatives, we believe that we should preserve the things that had worked,” Camargo said.

“And the way you’re going to embrace those ideals is, first, you appreciate what this country is, and I think PragerU does a really good job when it comes to that,” he added.

In her introductory statement, obtained by NBC News, Wynn-Williams will tell the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism that Meta executives “lied about what they were doing with the Chinese Communist Party to employees, shareholders, Congress, and the American public.”

“I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values,” she will say, according to the prepared remarks. “They did these things in secret to win favor with Beijing and build an $18 billion dollar business in China,” her statement says, referring to China-based advertisers.

Wynn-Williams, a former New Zealand diplomat, worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017. She believes she was fired in 2017 as retaliation for accusing her boss, Joel Kaplan, who at the time was a vice president for global public policy, of sexual harassment. Meta, which owns Facebook, said that an investigation cleared Kaplan in 2017 and that Wynn-Williams’ book, “Careless People,” included “false accusations about our executives.” Meta also said other claims in the book were “out-of-date and previously reported,” and a former supervisor said she was fired for performance reasons.

In a statement Tuesday night, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone criticized Wynn-Williams’ planned remarks.

“Sarah Wynn-Williams’ testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims,” Stone said in a statement. “While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”

Wednesday’s hearing is an indication of the scrutiny that Meta continues to receive in Washington, despite a monthslong effort by Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to pivot the company’s politics to the right, aligning more closely with the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., a fierce critic of the major tech platforms who is chairing the hearing, said earlier this year that conservatives should not trust the Big Tech companies simply because some of their leaders, including Zuckerberg, have now more openly embraced President Donald Trump.

“No, I don’t think so for a second,” he said. “I’m deeply concerned about their monopolistic power. That hasn’t changed at all, their ability to turn right back on the control of news and information, their control over our personal data — none of that has changed.”

Separately, Meta is preparing for another major fight in Washington next week, when the company is scheduled to go to trial against the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust case that could potentially see the breakup of Meta if it loses. The company owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.

Meta has sought to stop Wynn-Williams from speaking about her book, winning an interim decision last month from an arbitrator finding that she violated a nondisparagement clause in her severance agreement. The arbitrator ordered her to cease promoting her book and retract claims she had made that were “disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental.”

But her book has still become a hit, with three weeks on The New York Times’ bestseller list for nonfiction books.

""Careless People"" by Sarah Wynn-Williams. Elise Wrabetz / NBC News

In her introductory statement for Wednesday’s hearing, she wrote that she was testifying despite the arbitrator’s order because “the American people deserve to know the truth.”

Stone, from Meta, said that while the company objects to Wynn-Williams’ giving media interviews, the company’s position is that she’s not barred from testifying before Congress, by either her separation agreement or the arbitration award.

Wynn-Williams is expected to face questions both about Meta’s past and about its future plans, including with China and artificial intelligence.

“Facebook’s secret mission to get into China was called ‘Project Aldrin’ and was restricted to need-to-know staff,” Wynn-Williams is set to say in her testimony. “There was no bridge too far. Meta built a physical pipeline connecting the United States and China. Meta executives ignored warnings that this would provide backdoor access to the Chinese Communist Party, allowing them to intercept the personal data and private messages of American citizens. The only reason China does not currently have access to US user data through this pipeline is because Congress stepped in.”

The “physical pipeline” she mentions is a reference to a plan Facebook and Google announced in 2016 to build an undersea internet cable connecting Hong Kong and Los Angeles. They abandoned the Hong Kong portion of the idea in 2020.

Wynn-Williams will add that Meta began “briefing” Chinese officials “as early as 2015.”

“These briefings focused on critical emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence,” she will say. “The explicit goal being to help China outcompete American companies. There’s a straight line you can draw from these briefings to the recent revelations that China is developing AI models for military use, relying on Meta’s Llama model. Meta’s internal documents describe their sales pitch for why China should allow them in the market by quote ‘help[ing] China increase global influence and promote the China Dream.’”

Wynn-Williams appears to be referencing a report from Reuters published in November that said researchers linked to China’s People’s Liberation Army said that Meta’s Llama was used to build an AI tool for potential military use. At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that any use of Llama by the People’s Liberation Army would violate its policies.

In her book, Wynn-Williams said Facebook ignored concerns about expanding into China and plowed ahead with its efforts, writing that Zuckerberg committed to the idea of re-entering China in 2014 to grow the company’s user base. But by 2019, Zuckerberg said he had largely given up on breaking into the Chinese market because it was too difficult to come to an operating agreement. The company ultimately never released a mainstream consumer app in China.

In a 2019 speech, Zuckerberg all but ruled out the possibility and pivoted instead to attacking China’s record on free expression.

“I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought, maybe we could help create a more open society,” he said. “This is something that I worked hard on for a long time. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.”

But Wynn-Williams, in her testimony, will challenge Zuckerberg’s credibility on issues of free speech. Various parts of the “Project Aldrin” effort, named for astronaut Buzz Aldrin, have leaked over time. That includes the building of China-specific censorship tools.

“Meta’s dishonesty started with a betrayal of core American values,” she will say, according to the advanced copy of her remarks. “Mark Zuckerberg pledged himself a free speech champion. Yet I witnessed Meta work ‘hand in glove’ with the Chinese Communist Party to construct and test custom-built censorship tools that silenced and censored their critics.”",Lean Left

Mike Johnson's next big test

Speaker Mike Johnson is once again trying to muscle a major piece of legislation through the narrowly divided House. And once again, he is leaning on President Donald Trump to get the job done.

At the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Trump met with Johnson and a group of House Republicans who are not on board with a Senate-approved budget resolution that would unlock Trump’s policy agenda on tax cuts, immigration enforcement and military spending.

Asked whether Trump was able to change any minds, Johnson responded, “I think he did.” He went on to say, “I think we’ll be moving forward this week.”

But it’s clear he still has his work cut out for him, as Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong, Melanie Zanona and Julie Tsirkin report.

A slew of House conservatives have blasted the Senate’s budget blueprint for requiring just $4 billion in spending cuts. A version the House adopted earlier this year, by contrast, called for $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in spending cuts while largely steering clear of specifics.

After having attended the meeting with Trump, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said, “Math still doesn’t math.”

Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said earlier in the day: “Put it in writing. The Senate’s got to put the math in writing, like we did ... and let us look at it. We’ve got a solid group that’s a no on this.” He estimated that he was among 15 to 20 Republicans vowing to vote down the budget plan.

With the House divided at 220-213, Johnson can afford only three GOP defections.

Johnson has already found himself in a similar position several times this year. Passing a separate budget resolution and a bill to keep the government funded required last-minute arm-twisting of lawmakers concerned about spending levels, efforts that included phone calls from Trump.

The question now is whether that same playbook will work a third time.

Markets endure another roller-coaster day with tariffs set to kick in

It was another roller-coaster day for the stock market with President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs set to go into effect at midnight tonight, including an additional 50% on goods from China.

The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about its willingness to negotiate the gigantic tariffs announced last week, and both Trump and China have escalated their rhetoric around what has become an all-out trade war, Rob Wile writes.

“Sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit,” Trump told reporters about his tariff plans at a White House event.

In the markets: Asian and European markets rallied overnight, with U.S. stocks initially maintaining that momentum. But it would end up being a wild day for Wall Street, with the major indexes declining throughout the day. The S&P 500 swung about 7% — initially starting out strongly positive but finishing the day down 1.6%.

The tech-focused Nasdaq went through a similar swing, closing 2.2% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%.

Those major indexes are now sharply lower since Trump’s inauguration. The S&P 500 has lost 17% of its value, while the Nasdaq is down 22%.

On Capitol Hill: U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testified before the Senate Finance Committee and faced pointed questions from lawmakers in both parties about Trump’s trade plans.

Greer said the tariffs are “both” a short-term negotiating tool and a long-term punitive measure. He also declined to call the tariff escalation a trade war, since “most countries have said they’re not going to retaliate.”

Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican facing re-election next year in North Carolina who has expressed some skepticism over the tariff strategy, asked Greer: “Whose throat do I get to choke if this goes wrong?”

At the White House: The tariffs have also led to discord among Trump’s allies, with Elon Musk describing Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, as a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks.”

That came in response to Navarro’s taking a shot at Musk in a CNBC interview, in which he said Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is “not a car manufacturer” but a “car assembler” who obtains cheap parts for Tesla vehicles from abroad.

Wisconsin election underscores broad support for voter ID laws

By Steve Kornacki

For nearly two decades, Democrats have tried to sound the alarm over laws that require voters to produce government-issued identification to cast ballots. Last week offered yet another demonstration of just how little headway they’ve made with the public — including the rank and file of their own party.

On a day when the Democratic-backed candidate romped to a 10-point victory in an unusually high-profile state Supreme Court election, Wisconsin voters last Tuesday also approved an amendment to enshrine an existing voter ID law into the state constitution.

The amendment prevailed 63%-37%, a result made all the more striking given that Democrats appeared to turn out in disproportionately high numbers. In other words, support among Democratic for the voter ID ballot measure was not insignificant.

Just consider the two bluest counties in Wisconsin — the only two of the state’s 72 counties to vote against the amendment. In Milwaukee County, which Kamala Harris won by nearly 40 points last year and liberal Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford won by 50 last Tuesday, the voter ID amendment lost by only 2 points, 51%-49%. And in Madison-based Dane County, chock full of highly educated and politically liberal professionals, the voter ID measure lost by 28 points — a far cry from the 64-point drubbing GOP-aligned Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel suffered in the county.

That has become a familiar story over time. Requiring voter ID became a hot-button topic in the late aughts, with Republicans pushing for it at the state level and Democrats claiming it was a solution in search of a problem that amounted to an attempt to disenfranchise nonwhite voters. But all of the dire warnings from Democratic activists and leaders over the years have done little to dent the appeal of verifying identity before issuing ballots.

Here’s how national polling of adults has looked over the years:

Given this history, last week’s result in Wisconsin was hardly a shock. The court contest overshadowed the campaign over the amendment. That the amendment wouldn’t change the status quo (instead, it gives the status quo constitutional protection) probably took some wind out of the sails, too.

In the bigger picture, though, the result might prove to be an endpoint of sorts. Back when voter ID emerged as a contested issue, the self-interest for each party was easily apparent. Democrats in those days relied more heavily on politically disengaged voters, many of them nonwhite, who were more likely not to have the required ID (and not as likely to be motivated to acquire it simply for voting purposes). And it was Republicans then who drew much more heavily from highly engaged voters, many of them educated professionals, who reliably participated in elections.

But the party coalitions are shifting. Under Donald Trump, Republicans are insurgent among the nonwhite voters Democrats have long depended on, just as Democrats are making steady inroads into the GOP’s former white-collar base. The partisan self-interest on voter ID is now much less clear, which raises the question of whether either side will have much appetite for this fight.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been a very busy man the past week. By all accounts, he played a huge role in convincing at least some people on Wall Street (and in Congress) that Donald Trump doesn’t really mean what he’s been saying about tariffs and trade deficits for decades now and is in fact just using the tariff “stick” to get concessions from other countries on a broad range of policy concerns. Just as crucially, he personally lobbied the president himself to tone down his rhetoric in order to calm the markets, as Politico reported:

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Florida Sunday to encourage President Donald Trump to focus his message on negotiating favorable trade deals — or risk the stock market cratering further, according to two people familiar with the conversations, granted anonymity to share details of them.

Bessent, who landed with the president at the White House on Marine One Sunday night, told Trump that markets would remain in peril unless he started putting more emphasis on talking about his endgame with tariffs — winning deals with other countries.

Bessent’s takeover of tariff messaging from such trade-war enthusiasts as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did indeed reassure movers and shakers enough to quell (at least temporarily) a market meltdown, and probably (again, at least temporarily) head off a civil war in Trump’s inner circle between those who share the president’s love of tariffs and those who like quiet profiteering instead.

But much as investors owe Bessent trillions of dollars that might have been lost in a total market collapse, he also found time to offer reassurance to an unlikely audience through a very unlikely intermediary. Appearing in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the Treasury secretary had some cheerful news for the federal workers the administration is working so hard to lay off:

“On one side, the president is reordering trade,” Bessent said. “On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down federal borrowings.”

“That will give us the labor that we need for the new manufacturing,” Bessent continued, arguing artificial intelligence and automation would limit how many workers needed to fill new jobs.

While this sort of breezy faith in the infinite fungibility of labor is possible from 40,000 feet, how well will it work in practice? Let’s say you are a 55-year-old auditor at the IRS (very definitely a disfavored position under this administration). What sort of factory job will you be qualified to perform? Even if you find one, is it likely you’ll be able to support your family with the (preferably, from the GOP point of view) nonunionized wages you earn? Since we are living in an era when remote work is becoming illegal, how far must you move to find a smoke-belching factory that’s hiring, and what do you do about the many years that could elapse between federal worker layoffs in 2025 and this magical post-trade-war economy when U.S. manufacturing comes back? And to cite one more troubling problem: Is there a good chance that you, the redundant employee, could get ground up between the AI Elon Musk wants to use to perform your federal-sector job and the AI Scott Bessent suggests will minimize the need for manufacturing labor?

If there are good answers to these questions, we’d all like to hear them from the ever-reassuring Bessent. But it’s worth noting that his entire rap may represent quite the dog whistle to some dark corners of Trump’s MAGA base, where the idea of forcing pointy-headed pencil pushers to do some real work is very popular, as Rotimi Adeoye explained in a fascinating Washington Post column about the online reaction to “Liberation Day”:

Recently, a viral meme in MAGA circles captured the moment, featuring a cartoon Trump addressing a faceless American: “Your great grandfather worked the mines, your grandfather worked in a steel plant, and you thought you could be a ‘product manager’???” It’s a joke, but it’s also a worldview — one where white-collar ambition is seen not as a step forward, but as a fall into decadence. The meme doesn’t just mock digital work; it exalts physical labor as the only authentic form of contribution.

What we’re seeing is a kind of MAGA Maoism, remixed for the algorithm age. Like the Chinese Cultural Revolution, it glorifies physical labor as moral purification, only now the purification is from the supposed “wokeness” of desk work, filtered through TikTok, X and Twitch. It’s not about creating jobs. It’s about creating vibes: strong men doing hard things, reshared until they become ideology. As one MAGA influencer put it, “Men in America don’t need therapy. Men in America need tariffs and DOGE. The fake email jobs will disappear.”

This back-to-the-future approach inverts the old neoliberal myth that training for higher-skill jobs will absorb obsolete forms of work, notes Adeoye:

Populists used to share memes about miners who were condescendingly told to “learn to code” while their towns struggled. The coders, in this updated version, need to be thrown back in the mines.

There’s also an intensely reactionary gender politics at work in some of this MAGA joy over white-collar jobs vanishing, as David Atkins observes in a particularly vivid depiction of where Trump is leading the country:

[T]he project is about deskilling America: reducing white-collar work through AI and remote job cuts, destroying universities, starving higher education, using tariffs to wall off the country as a manufacturing-and-extraction island, gutting the cities, and pushing men into manual labor while nudging women into domestic roles.

Now we don’t know that Scott Bessent shares this atavistic vision of burly proles assembling iPhones and mining lithium to power them as their women stay home to breed the next generation of workers and war fighters. But there is something to the idea that everyone in Trump’s orbit is enjoying the agony of DOGE’s victims as though they deserve punishment and a bleaker future.",Left

Stock in Tesla, Musk’s electric vehicle (EV) company, has lost more than 38 percent of its value so far this year, the Washington Post reported.

The billionaire DOGE chief’s comments came after Trump unveiled status quo-breaking tariffs from the White House last week, saying, “They charge us, we charge them.”

Navarro responded to Musk’s initial insults during a Monday CNBC appearance, calling him a “car assembler” who wants to keep his costs down:

https://twitter.com/EdKrassen/status/1909230830691463548

Look, Elon Musk and his DOGE team is making contributions to America in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse. And that’s a very good thing for this country and the American people. […] But he’s not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler, in many cases. If you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets — which, in the EV case — is the batteries come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan… What we want, and the difference is in our thinking and Elon’s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here. This business model where BMW and Mercedes come in to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security.

“And with Elon, it’s fine. He’s a car man — he’s a car person. That’s what he does. And he wants the cheap foreign parts. And we understand that,” Navarro added.

While Navarro claimed that the rift between himself and Musk is “no big deal,” the Tesla CEO continued his tirade in a series of Tuesday X posts.

“Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,” Musk said in response to the Trump adviser’s claims on CNBC:

“Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,” he added in a follow-up post, citing a 2023 Kelly Blue Book study.

Musk then jabbed at the fictional trade expert that Navarro included in his 2011 book Death by China, “Ron Vara,” which is an anagram of the economy counselor’s surname:

“By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content,” Musk wrote. “Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara.”

In another play on Navarro’s name, the tech entrepreneur called him “Peter Retarrdo”:

“I’d like to apologize to bricks for calling Peter Retarrdo dumber than a sack of bricks. That was so unfair to bricks,” Musk wrote in yet another follow-up:

When asked about the public spat between the two high-level Trump administration officials on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “boys will be boys”:

Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue. And, you guys should all be very grateful that we have the most transparent administration in history. And I think it also speaks to the president’s willingness to hear from all sides — that he has people at the highest levels of this government and this White House who have very diverse opinions on very diverse issues, but the president takes all opinions in mind, and then he makes the best decision based on the best interests of the American public.

Musk has been a longtime critic of tariffs, with Tesla filing a lawsuit during Trump’s first term in a bid to overturn the tax on Chinese imports, the Washington Post reported.

The billionaire’s brother and fellow Tesla board member, Kimbal Musk, has also criticized the president’s tariffs and Navarro’s role in them, calling the adviser a “C-minus student” in a Tuesday post:

“Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations,” Kimbal wrote in another post. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.”

The Tesla brothers’ negative remarks came just a month after Trump promoted Tesla vehicles at the White House.

On Monday, Trump said that “virtually every country wants to negotiate,” as the tariffs are set to take effect Wednesday, Breitbart News reported.

China, on the other hand, has slapped the U.S. with its own 34 percent retaliatory tariff, prompting the Trump administration to levy a staggering 104 percent tariff on the country to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.

The White House’s decision to punish The Associated Press by eliminating its access to President Donald Trump’s events, the Oval Office and Air Force One is unconstitutional, a federal judge said Tuesday.

The preliminary injunction issued Tuesday afternoon against the White House by Judge Trevor McFadden, a first-term Trump appointee, is a major blow to the administration’s efforts to curtail the AP’s access to the president based on news coverage it dislikes.

And it’s a critical legal victory for one of the world’s biggest news outlets and wire services, whose reporting has been hamstrung by an administration with an axe to grind against it.

“The Government offers no other plausible explanation for its treatment of the AP. The Constitution forbids viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum like the Oval Office,” McFadden, of the US District Court in Washington, DC, wrote in the 41-page ruling.

Earlier this year, Trump imposed a ban on the AP to punish the news organization over its decision to continue using the phrase “Gulf of Mexico” after Trump renamed the body of water the “Gulf of America.”

“The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,” McFadden wrote. “That is all the Court orders today: For the Government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP’s use of disfavored terminology.”

“The Court merely declares that the AP’s exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the Government from continuing down that unlawful path,” McFadden continued.

McFadden, however, did not immediately restore the AP’s access. He delayed his order for one week for the White House to appeal.

“We are gratified by the court’s decision,” Lauren Easton, a spokesperson for the AP, said in a statement. “Today’s ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to continuing to provide factual, nonpartisan and independent coverage of the White House for billions of people around the world.”

McFadden wrote that his ruling does not prevent the White House from limiting the AP’s access to certain presidential events and spaces for “permissible reasons.”

“The Court does not order the Government to grant the AP permanent access to the Oval Office, the East Room, or any other media event. It does not bestow special treatment upon the AP,” he wrote. “But it cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either.”

And he noted that while the White House in February took control of deciding who is part of the small rotating group of journalists and photographers known as the “press pool” that accompanies the president, that undertaking did not change its “constitutional obligation to refrain from viewpoint discrimination in selecting media outlets for participation.”

The ruling, which was issued nearly two weeks after a veteran AP photographer and its chief White House correspondent testified about the damage the ban has done to the outlet, makes clear the administration’s retaliatory actions “have poisoned the AP’s business model” and caused it irreparable harm.

“As its ability to rapidly supply new photographs and breaking news has dwindled, the AP’s customers have expressed concerns and turned to other sources for their needs,” McFadden wrote. “The AP has been economically hemorrhaging for the last two months, and its condition will only worsen as its customers flee to other news services absent injunctive relief.”

The AP’s chief White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, told the court in his testimony that the outlet was forced to report in a “delayed fashion” and that its coverage did not have “the same level of completeness.” Evan Vucci, the AP’s chief photographer in Washington, testified that the outlet was “really struggling to keep up” with its competitors.

Most other major news outlets are still using “Gulf of Mexico,” although the AP is thus far the only outlet part of the press pool that’s been singled out. The outlet’s journalists have retained their White House press credentials.

“So why has the AP alone been penalized? The AP claims, and the Court now finds, that the Government has singled out the AP because of its refusal to update the Gulf’s name in its Stylebook, an influential writing and editing guide,” McFadden wrote in his ruling.

Though the AP has changed how it refers to Mount McKinley, which Trump renamed from Denali, it said it would stick with the “Gulf of Mexico” because it is an international body of water and other countries do not recognize the new name. As a global news outlet with customers all around the world, the AP said it will continue using the name “Gulf of Mexico” in its news coverage and influential stylebook while still acknowledging the new “Gulf of America” name.

Shortly after the case was filed in February, the judge declined to issue an emergency court order that would have restored the AP’s access while he considered whether to issue a preliminary injunction. At the time, he said appeared somewhat skeptical of the legality of the ban, describing it as “discriminatory” and “problematic.”

House Concurrent Resolution 20, introduced by Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., would create a voluntary program that would allow students who successfully complete the challenge to receive a signed certificate from the speaker of the House, president pro tempore of the Senate, and the student’s senator and congressman.
""Listen, because we need to be in shape, man,"" Tyson told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""We can't physically get into an army because we're out of shape. And that's embarrassing. So it comes across we're the most heavy, heaviest people in the planet.

It would apply to students in K-12 public and private schools, groups that provide the testing to home schoolers, and members of Congress who hold a ""community-based event"" for the challenge, the current text states.
According to the resolution, the benchmarks will be inspired by ""historical"" lines for the Presidential Physical Fitness Test, which was popularized under the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the 1960s.
""So we got to make sure that they're physically fit. Now is the perfect time to be instituting this once again, because we understand President Trump through his Cabinet picks and through what his campaign promises have been with the America First agenda, where he wants to make America healthy again,"" Hamadeh said.
The test itself would entail a mile-long run or walk, pull-ups or a flexed arm hang, curl-ups, sit-ups, shuttle runs, and sit-and-reach. Those who perform well would be divided into gold, silver, and bronze levels. The gold level would be in the top 85th percentile, silver would cover the top 75th percentile, and bronze would be in the top 50th percentile, the legislation states.
Tyson added that actions like this give him hope for the future.
""I think this is going to improve, and people are going to get better, and people want to get healthier. I just believe that,"" he said.

Tariffs were unpopular before President Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election but have become even less popular since then, according to a new poll.
Newsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment.
Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of countries last week with the aim of closing the trade deficit and restoring U.S. manufacturing. However, economists warn that this could come at a cost to American consumers through higher prices. The stock market reacted negatively to Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 7 percent since last Wednesday.
The tariffs' popularity and impact on the economy will be crucial to the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections. The economy has been on voters' minds for years, and Democrats believe higher prices caused by the tariffs could spark a backlash against Trump.
A new poll from Navigator Research shows that Americans' views of tariffs have become more negative since August 2024, though Republicans have generally grown more supportive of the policy.
The latest poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters from April 3 to April 7, 2025, found that 58 percent of Americans view tariffs unfavorably, compared to 30 percent who view them favorably, giving them a -28 disapproval.
In August, that number was only -11. Tariffs fell to a -15 approval rating by December 8 and a -13 rating by February 13. According to the polling firm, it dropped to -23 by March 17.
Only 4 percent of Democrats view tariffs favorably, compared to 23 percent of independents and 58 percent of Republicans, Navigator found.
Grant Davis Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, told Newsweek it's ""not at all"" surprising that tariffs have dropped in popularity, as the millions of Americans who hold stocks have seen the value of those assets decrease.
""The skid has been particularly painful and disconcerting for those over 50 looking at their 401(k) accounts,"" he said. It's been a train wreck, in fact.""
The tariffs have created a political challenge for Republicans, he said, as Americans simply don't like being ""jerked around financially,"" and some damage has already been done. The midterms were already likely to be costly for the GOP, but Republicans' likelihood of losing control of the House is ""pretty much a lock.""
He described the tariffs as ""one of the biggest unforced errors in modern politics.""
""Trump likes chaos and uncertainty but here he has created a political monster, which in this instance Dr. Frankenstein cannot control,"" he said.
Syracuse University Political Science Professor Grant Davis Reeher told Newsweek: ""Prior to this moment, we had also been exposed to media accounts that the consensus among economists was that these kinds of tariffs would not be good for the economy and would lead to rising prices, and even perhaps a recession. None of that sounds good to the average voter. Even many Republican supporters of Trump in Congress seem to be drawing the line here.""
White House Senior Counselor Peter Navarro told Fox News: ""I guarantee no recession. Why? Because when we pass the biggest, broadest tax cut in history within a matter of months, that's going to be a great stimulus.""
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in his annual letter released Monday: ""The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession. And even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.""
President Donald Trump, while announcing the new tariffs on Wednesday, said: ""Chronic trade deficits are a national emergency.""
The 10 percent tariffs on all global imports went into effect on Saturday, and the country-specific reciprocal tariffs will begin on Wednesday. This includes 104 percent tariffs on goods imported from China.",Center

Autocratic leaders love to have parades that show off military might. And it’s even better if the display of power glorifies them personally in some manner. So, naturally, Donald Trump has long dreamed of holding a military parade in Washington, D.C. For years, he has been thwarted, but now he may finally get his way — and on his birthday no less.

Saturday, June 14, happens to be both the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and Trump’s 79th birthday. Festivities to celebrate the Army milestone, including activities and displays on the National Mall, have been in the works for about two years. And now the Trump administration is reportedly looking to add a parade that would stretch nearly four miles, from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River, into D.C.

Washington City Paper broke the news on Sunday, reporting that local officials were just learning of the request:

Arlington County Board Chair Takis Karantonis, who describes Arlington as a “9/11 city” that is proud of being home to the Pentagon, tells City Paper that no formal request for assistance has been made to the county. Karantonis says the county was given a “heads up” about the parade on Friday by the White House, but with no firm details.

“It’s not clear to me what the scope of a parade would be,” Karantonis says. “But I would hope the federal government remains sensitive to the pain and concerns of numerous [military] veteran residents who have lost or might lose their jobs in recent federal decisions, as they reflect on how best to celebrate the Army’s anniversary.”

On Monday, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump-administration officials had contacted the city’s special-events task force, per Politico.

However, if officials are looking into holding a parade this year, they aren’t ready to admit it. The White House issued a statement saying that “no military parade has been scheduled.” (Of course, that doesn’t mean a parade won’t be scheduled; it just hasn’t happened yet.)

An Army spokesman responded with a more equivocal statement, telling the AP, “It’s too early to say yet whether or not we’re having a parade, but we’re working with the White House as well as several government agencies to make the celebration a national-level event.”

Trump first said he wanted a military parade in 2017, several months after he attended one in Paris for Bastille Day. The following year, he announced he had canceled plans for the parade, accusing local officials of price gouging as the estimated cost of the event ballooned as high as $92 million.

“The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it,” he wrote on Twitter. “When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!”

Bowser still isn’t thrilled about having tanks roll through D.C. “Military tanks on our streets would not be good,” the mayor told reporters this week. “If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads.”

So will Trump actually get his parade this time? On the one hand, this is still a costly and logistically difficult undertaking. On the other hand, “Do whatever Trump wants” seems to be the theme of his second administration. And it’s clear the president who played with a Mack truck in front of the White House would really like to see some cool tanks drive right past his house on his birthday.",Left

SEC HEGSETH TO VISIT PANAMA AFTER TRUMP'S DEMANDS FOR CANAL'S RETURN
Panama has repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s claims that China effectively controls the canal as it operates two major ports on either end of the waterway. 
However, the Central American nation withdrew from its 2017 Belt and Road Initiative agreements with Beijing earlier this year in a signal that Panama has chosen to side with the Trump administration in this geopolitical spat.
Hegseth laid out a litany of joint exercises, operations and the general presence of the U.S. military in and around the canal in a move to counter China, though Fox News Digital could not immediately reach the Pentagon to confirm whether this signified an increase in U.S. presence in the region.

""Our relationship with Panama, especially our security relationship, will continue to grow in the months and years ahead,"" Hegseth said. ""Our relationship is growing in part to meet communist China's rising challenges.""
The defense secretary said China-based companies continue to install ""critical infrastructure"" in the canal, which gives China the ""potential"" ability to ""conduct surveillance.""

The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's slim GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.

The president met with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.

Johnson said he thought Mr. Trump helped change some minds. ""The president was very helpful and engaged. We had a lot of members whose questions were answered,"" the House speaker said after the White House meeting, adding that they're ""making great progress.""

But several holdouts said they didn't attend the meeting — or weren't invited.

House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.

The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of ""the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.""

""There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!"" Mr. Trump continued, adding that ""THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.""

He continued to put pressure on the holdouts in a Tuesday post that said, ""I AM FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS! WE ARE GOING TO DO REDUCTIONS, hopefully in excess of $1 Trillion Dollars.""

But many of the holdouts want assurances that there will be much more than $1 trillion in cuts.

The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.

The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.

Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.

In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.

The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method known as ""current policy,"" which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.

But the tax cuts were originally passed using ""current law"" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.

House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.

Johnson met with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.

""It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,"" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.

Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.

""They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,"" Roy said Tuesday. ""That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.""

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the hurdles ahead at the GOP leadership's news conference Tuesday morning, saying ""nobody said it would be easy."" But the Louisiana Republican added that ""our commitment is firm in getting this done.""

""There are members that have questions — that's not a surprise,"" Scalise said. ""Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.""

Johnson stressed that ""the budget resolution is not the law,"" noting that ""all this does is it allows us to continue the process, begin drafting the actual legislation that actually counts — and that's the one big beautiful bill.""

The speaker said adopting the resolution simply ""allows us to get off the sidelines and get on the field and start this game.""

""It's the kickoff,"" he added.

Donald Trump’s return to the presidency was made possible by two conclusions reached by a crucial bloc of swing voters: that Democratic management of the economy had become intolerably bad, and that in retrospect Trump’s management of the economy during his first term had been tolerably good, despite dire circumstances (the 2020 pandemic) for which no one blamed him. So as he moved back into the White House, he might have enjoyed an extended honeymoon in public opinion, with Joe Biden’s administration continuing to bear the blame for continuing economic problems and Trump being given the time to put his own domestic and international agenda into action.

Instead, as became almost instantly clear, Trump chose speed and audacity for the implementation of his second-term plans, dominating not only the news but every counterforce in Washington, D.C., or around the country that might have slowed the pace of breakage. And while his job-approval ratings have eroded slowly, the 47th president might have given himself a lot more leash to do destructive things had he let the economy run itself for long enough to achieve the “soft landing” from the previous era of inflation that the Fed and indeed the Biden administration had prepared for him.

But instead, Trump destabilized the global economy for the foreseeable future by pursuing a trade war that Wall Street wizards chose not to anticipate in their wishful thinking about his priorities and his advisers. Now any given day markets may rise or fall, projections of catastrophe may wax or wane, and wishful thinking may be revived. If Trump takes his Treasury secretary’s advice, he will feed hopes that his tariff program will go away once he’s secured from U.S. trading partners the kind of kowtowing concessions his ego demands in every circumstance in life.

But the sickening lurch of markets and the anxious fears of impending recession (if not the immensely more destructive condition known as “stagflation”) that greeted Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcements put an emphatic end point to any fantasies that hard times could be retroactively blamed on Joe Biden or prospectively attributed to some bipartisan “Establishment” determined to thwart American Greatness. Trump has placed his personal stamp on the 2025 economy as emphatically as he possibly could, defying every bit of conventional wisdom about how to navigate a complex and even fragile global environment. He broke the economy as we knew it, so now he owns it, for good or for ill. Since he also totally owns the Republican Party that in turn totally owns the federal government, we have now definitively entered a Trump era where not a sparrow may fall to the ground without full presidential responsibility for the consequences.

Trump’s determination to break things has, as my colleague Ross Barkan noted, made life immensely easier for the opposition party whose divisions and lack of leadership hardly matter at present. But more generally, Trump and his party now bear the entire burden of chronic American unhappiness with living conditions and with a government they expect to make life better. To get a sense of Trump’s public standing going forward, we should look not just at his job-approval ratings (which have been underwater most of his political career) but at public sentiment about the direction of the country. And while MAGA excitement over Trump’s unlikely comeback has initially put a floor beneath “wrong track” sentiment, it’s still strong and probably about to get a lot stronger.

According to the RealClearPolitics averages, 41.9 percent of Americans think the country is on the “right track,” and 52.0 percent think it’s on the “wrong track.” It will be interesting to watch that number as the recent stock-market carnage sinks in, and as it becomes clearer that the administration is pursuing the eternally unpopular agenda of cuts in programs like Medicaid in order to finance upper-end tax cuts, even as the wrecking ball of DOGE makes government more dysfunctional than ever and secret police snatch people off the streets. It’s Trump’s, not Joe Biden’s, America now, and its blood — financial and human — is on his hands.",Left

This is also known as terrorism.

The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) recently issued a new report which “found that a growing number of people are willing to justify and even applaud killing in the name of politics and a warped sense of social justice,” per Fox News. “The chilling change appears to have accelerated in recent months.”

Joel Finkelstein, one of the lead authors of the report, told Fox: “What was formerly taboo culturally has become acceptable [on the left]. We are seeing a clear shift – glorification, increased attempts and changing norms – all converging into what we define as ‘assassination culture.’”

That is the study’s term for it: “assassination culture.”

According to the study, the left’s embrace of violence to achieve a political end began with the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. After Luigi Mangione was arrested and charged with the assassination, the left immediately turned him into a folk hero. There is even a ballot measure in California called the Luigi Mangione Access to Health Care Act.

Finkelstein explained that the Luigi fanboying merely opened the door to this frightening acceptability. The left’s assassination culture has spread ever since.

“It’s not just Luigi anymore,” Finkelstein told Fox. “We’re seeing an expansion: Trump, Musk and others are now being openly discussed as legitimate targets, often cloaked in meme culture and gamified online dialogue.”

This culture can be found primarily in Democrat safe spaces like the X alternative BlueSky.

The most chilling information is found in the NCRI poll of 1,200 adults. A disturbing 48.6 percent of those who self-identify as “left of center” said the murder of Elon Musk is justifiable. That number increased to 55.2 percent for President Trump. When asked if “destroying Tesla dealerships is partially acceptable,” 57.6 percent of leftists said yes.

“BlueSky was modeled as a safe alternative to Twitter for the left, but what it’s become is an extremist platform,” Finkelstein explained.

He clarified: “We are not an anti-free speech organization, but we know what a threat is. And what’s happening online on platforms like BlueSky represents a significant threat to American democratic values.”

Rather than censor this assassination culture, Finkelstein said: “If leaders on the left explicitly condemn these trends and reassert moral norms, they can dismantle this culture quickly.”

And therein lies the problem.

Leading Democrats will never condemn political violence because they approve of political violence that furthers their cause. The corporate media will never pressure Democrats to condemn this violence because the corporate media approve of (and encourage) political violence that furthers the leftist cause.

Between public schooling, a celebrity culture that promotes narcissism as a virtue, not to mention the everybody-gets-a-trophy mindset of entitlement, what we have among us are millions of leftists who cannot psychologically deal with not getting their way.

Donald Trump’s triumphant reelection sent them spinning. To begin with, after railing against anyone who questioned the 2020 presidential election results, the left could not purge their anger by questioning Trump’s victory—something they’ve done to cope with Republican presidential victories for 25 years. There was no Russia Collusion Hoax this time, either.

Add to Trump’s victory how he hit the ground running with executive orders dismantling the corrupt Deep State infrastructure, like USAID, combined with DOGE, and the left now sees (correctly — tee hee) an existential threat to their national power. They also see in Trump someone who has assembled a loyal and capable team immune to the corporate media’s tired emotional blackmail and other tricks.

The result is a leftist meltdown driven by fear and helplessness. But rather than use next year’s midterm elections as a release valve by organizing and making a case for why the public should trust them again with power, the left is seething with rationalizations for violence against their political enemies.

Get out of the blue cities.

Buy guns.

Have nothing to do with affluent white women who vote Democrat.

As the crawling pace of congressional Republican action on Trump’s legislative agenda has shown, cutting taxes by a few trillion dollars when the federal government is already running record deficits and debt is hard work. Sure, regular MAGA folk may think that federal spending is just a target-rich environment of wokeness, waste, and welfare (defined as benefits other people surely don’t deserve). But people in Congress know it’s not that easy.

Thirty-six percent of federal spending is on Social Security and Medicare, which Republicans generally try to leave alone (though Elon Musk is definitely violating all rules of political prudence by greatly interfering with the Social Security Administration). Another 13 percent goes for national security, which Republicans invariably try to increase. And still another 13 percent is devoted to interest payments on existing debt, which must be paid. So three-fourths of the budget is basically off-limits as a source of funds to pay for the roughly $5.3 trillion in tax cuts (over ten years) Team Trump and its congressional allies want authorized as part of the “one beautiful” budget-reconciliation bill they intend to enact by the end of the summer. And because budget-reconciliation bills deal with long-term mandatory spending required by law, not annual appropriations that Congress can in theory take or leave, the spending cuts need to come from entitlement programs; discretionary spending cuts (being made so heavily by Musk) are just short-term pocket change from a big-picture point of view.

So if you take all the sacred cows of the federal budget off the table, there’s really just a small pot of money, most of it targeted to low-income Americans, that’s available for plundering to pay for those all-important tax cuts. Less than a half-trillion goes to what we usually think of as “welfare” (income-maintenance programs for poor families, food stamps and other nutrition programs, and low-income tax credits). Then there’s around $600 billion for Medicaid, and the closely associated Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and another $100 billion and change for Obamacare marketplace subsidies. The biggest target of all is Medicaid, the principal source of health insurance for 72 million Americans.

Cutting Medicaid may be less unpopular than cutting Social Security or Medicare, but it’s still unpopular. A recent national poll of registered voters from the firm of Donald Trump’s own pollster, Tony Fabrizio, shows limited willingness to cut Medicaid even among the president’s own supporters:

Voters oppose cutting Medicaid by a 69 to 23 percent margin. Trump voters oppose Medicaid cuts by 10 points, while swing voters oppose by a sizable 48-point margin.

Now voters, particularly Trump voters, really like the idea of tax cuts. But when asked if they’d support financing tax cuts with Medicaid cuts, the reaction was impressively negative:

When asked specifically if voters support or oppose cutting Medicaid spending to pay for tax cuts, they oppose it by a 50-point margin, 70 to 20 percent, with a 54 percent majority strongly opposing cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts. Two-thirds of swing voters oppose this as do Trump voters by a 15-point margin.

That’s right: Half of Trump voters oppose this specific trade-off, which is precisely what congressional Republicans are looking at doing. The House-passed congressional budget resolution assumes $898 billion over ten years coming out of the programs supervised by the Energy and Commerce Committee. The vast majority of those savings will have to come from Medicaid.

There are two major evasions of this terrible problem being advanced by congressional Republicans, one in the Senate and one in the House. The Senate is, for the moment at least, defining much of the problem away by deeming $3.6 trillion in tax cuts (the portion representing extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which expire at the end of this year) as having no impact on the deficit, and thus as “free,” requiring no spending-cut offsets. That reduces the pressure to whack Medicaid, and, indeed, the Senate version of the budget resolution absolutely requires no more than $4 billion in spending cuts. The House, meanwhile, is trying to pretend it can wring significant savings out of Medicaid without reducing actual benefits by going after — you guessed it — waste, fraud, and abuse.

One tack from the House will likely be to impose a national work requirement on Medicaid beneficiaries, which might be reasonably popular in theory. But as the Kaiser Family Foundation noted of Medicaid recipients under 65, that may be a shallow well of dollars:

Ninety-two percent were working full or part time (64 percent) or not working due to caregiving responsibilities (12 percent), illness or disability (10 percent), or school attendance (7 percent). The remaining 8 percent of Medicaid adults reported that they are retired, unable to find work, or were not working for another reason.

A more profitable source of federal Medicaid savings may come from one or more methods of shifting costs to the states, which currently pay (overall) 31 percent of the program’s expenditures. In 2017, the failed Republican bill to repeal Obamacare would have simply capped federal Medicaid expenditures at a fixed amount per beneficiary and forced the states to pick up the rest. Now there’s talk of lowering the exceptionally high match rate set for those covered by the Medicaid expansion authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately for congressional Republicans, that would really hammer people in red states where either legislators or voters recently pushed through a Medicaid expansion, particularly those with laws requiring abandonment of state coverage if the Fed tries to welsh on the original arrangement. Overall, the KFF estimates, a drop in the federal match rate for the expanded Medicaid population is likely to deny health insurance to 20 million Americans. That’s a “Medicaid cut” by anyone’s definition.

So what will Trump and the GOP do? They are very unlikely to go back on their ambitious tax-cut plans unless everything falls apart. There may be a limit to exactly how much lying they can do about the deficit impact of tax cuts or their ability to generate many hundreds of billions of dollars in savings from eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse.” So eventually, we will likely see the same debate that turned out so poorly for Republicans in 2017 with cutting Medicaid to pay for high-end tax cuts becoming less popular every day. Then the question will become whether Trump & Co. even care about public opinion.",Left

The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to keep several thousand probationary federal employees it is attempting to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal, the latest in a series of wins for the White House at the conservative high court.

The Supreme Court’s decision blocks a ruling from a lower court judge that required the government to temporarily reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees.

In a brief, two-paragraph order, the court said that the unions who filed the litigation didn’t have standing to sue. The decision didn’t address the merits of the arguments, and it is not the final word on whether the employees will be allowed to keep their jobs, but it will have a significant impact on both the workers and the agencies in the meantime.

Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – publicly dissented. Jackson offered a brief explanation, questioning the need for the high court to enter into the case on an emergency basis.

The full implications of the ruling are not clear given that a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the case before the Supreme Court.

Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said that the decision was a relatively limited one.

“All that the court said here is that the nonprofit organizations who obtained an injunction in San Francisco weren’t the right parties to challenge the mass firings,” he said. “It’s another win for Trump, but once again only with regard to who can and can’t sue, and in which courts. Other challenges to the mass firings have already resulted in rulings against the government in other cases, and those remain in place.”

Still, the decision was a win for the Trump administration, which had asked the high court to step into the case to toss out the lower court’s order. It came a day after the court also allowed the administration to continue deportations under the controversial Alien Enemies Act – though with some new limitations added.

In its effort to slash the size of the federal government, the Trump administration has targeted probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While those employees generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they may do so if the action stemmed from “partisan political reasons” or “marriage status.”

In the case at hand, labor unions and other groups had challenged the Office of Personnel Management’s role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.

US District Judge William Alsup, nominated by President Bill Clinton, ordered the administration to “immediately” offer over 16,000 probationary employees their jobs back.

“Each agency had (and still has) discretion to hire and fire its own employees,” Alsup wrote in his opinion. “Here, the agencies were directed by OPM to fire all probationary employees, and they executed that directive. To staunch the irreparable harms to organizational plaintiffs caused by OPM unlawfully slashing other agency’s staff required immediately reinstating those employees.”

But Trump framed the case as another example of the federal judiciary stepping in to manage the decisions it says should be left to the executive branch.

“The district court’s extraordinarily overbroad remedy is now inflicting ongoing, irreparable harm on the Executive Branch that warrants this Court’s urgent intervention,” Sarah Harris, who was then the administration’s acting solicitor general, told the Supreme Court.

BANGKOK -- A U.S. political science scholar accused by the Thai Army of insulting the Southeast Asian nation’s monarchy, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison, was jailed on Tuesday pending trial.

Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, last week was summoned by police to hear the charges against him, including violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activity.

Chambers has specialized in studying the power and influence of the military in Thailand. The army plays a major role in politics and has staged 13 successful coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently just 11 years ago.

He reported himself to the police Tuesday to formally acknowledge the charges and then was taken to Phitsanulok Provincial Court for a pretrial detention hearing, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group.

It said the court approved the police request for pretrial detention and denied Chambers’ initial application for release on bail, as well as a second later request. The legal aid group said another request to allow bail would be filed to an appeals court on Wednesday. No trial date has been set.

The officer who answered the phone at the police station handling the case said he could not comment, and referred the matter to his chief, who did not answer a call to his phone.

It is not unusual for Thai courts to deny bail in cases involving the offense of insulting the monarchy, which is also called lese majeste, and popularly known as “112” after its article number in the criminal code.

The U.S.-based academic freedom project Scholars at Risk said in a statement that Chambers in late 2024 made comments in a webinar about a restructuring of the military believed to be the cause of the complaint made against him by the 3rd Army Area, covering Thailand’s northern region.

“State authorities should refrain from criminal investigations and other coercive legal action intended to restrict or retaliate against such conduct,” said the statement.

The lese majeste law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has been used to punish critics of the government and institutions such as the military.

The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticism of it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.

However, public debate on the topic has in the past decade grown louder, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020, began openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law.

Chicago remains the homicide capital of America — 13 years straight. According to an analysis by Wirepoints, 573 homicides were committed in Chicago during 2024 at the rate of 21.5 homicides per 100,000 residents. These depressing numbers far exceed those of other major cities like New York City, Houston and Los Angeles. 
Yet most of Chicago’s city leaders may as well be living on another plant. They refuse to look at reality in all of its ugliness. After an unruly mob of over 300 kids took over Streeterville and the Loop recently, Mayor Brandon Johnson said the solution was more ""safe spaces."" Safe spaces for whom?
Anybody who knows Streeterville, home to the Navy Pier, knows that it is one of the safest neighborhoods in all of Chicago. In fact, there were two shootings in March — both were due to large gatherings of teen mobs.
CHICAGO DUBBED AMERICA'S MURDER CAPITAL AS DEMOCRAT LEADERS 'DEMONIZE' POLICE, SPLURGE ON MIGRANTS: ALDERMAN
That’s two shootings that could have been prevented had the city taken this problem seriously long before. When Mayor Johnson first took office there were three consecutive nights of street takeovers in the Loop and nearby areas. Fellow Chicagoans and out of towners were assaulted. Stores had their windows smashed and were robbed. 
When we raised our collective outrage back then, Mayor Johnson chastised us for ""demonizing children."" He went on to say, ""They’re young. Sometimes they make silly decisions. They do. And so, we have to make sure that we are investing to make sure that young people know they are supported.""
I didn’t see anything ""silly"" about those videos showing these kids bashing innocent people over the head. I also rejected the mayor’s false argument that we’re demonizing these kids. What everyone was outraged about was the behavior of these kids and that it had been allowed to continue for many hours without any law and order. 
Clearly, this delusional approach by the mayor hasn’t worked. Even he knows it. After the recent run of teenage mobs, the mayor said he would ""not tolerate"" this behavior any longer. But where is his solution? His plan? 
CHICAGO ALDERMAN SLAMS THE MURDER CAPITAL’S ‘DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE’
I never put any of my faith in him. I didn’t vote for him and was immensely disappointed when he won. I knew that Chicago would just continue with business as usual. Now, I’m seeing more and more Chicagoans wake up to the reality of this mayor. Many of them betrayed their common sense and voted for him because of identity politics. But the reality of the horror show that this mayor is has become too much for them to bear, especially when children are at stake.

We know the only way to reach our youth is to become involved in their lives. I’ve been doing this work on the South Side for decades and I can tell you that it works. It is not perfect — I have preached at far too many funerals for teens — but it does save many lives from the fate of the bullet. 
What we do is very simple. We talk to these kids, find out where they’re at, what their demons are, and we let them know we understand. We know they’re being targeted every day for membership into gangs and we strive to counter that with the belief they can become somebodies with their shot at the American Dream.

What we don’t do is provide these kids with ""safe spaces."" What is the point of a safe space if violence still reigns outside the door. What we do instead is strive to make their communities safer. That is what gives these kids that sense of security and freedom to focus on developing their skills and ambitions. 
My community center, Project H.O.O.D., reduced the homicide rate in our neighborhood of Woodlawn by 50% from 2021 to 2022. 
Most of those kids running inside those mobs don’t have any of that. They’re lost. They’re sheep running wherever the mob takes them. They commit violence because it is all they have to offer society at that moment. They come of age during Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police and they know there’s nobody around who cares enough to stop them. In other words, they’re pushing the limits of our society as far as they can because they know they can. 
Our mayor and most of our city leaders are guilty of indulging these teen mobs. They believe they can baby these kids to safety. But I can tell you that’s not what these kids want. Many of them want to be a man or woman of importance. They want to matter. But they don’t know how because their parents have failed them, their schools have failed them, their leaders have failed them and now they are failing themselves.

The only solution is to shock them back into reality by showing them that there are consequences for their actions. Alderman Brian Hopkins has called for imposing an 8 pm curfew on these youths to help the Chicago Police Department get a grip on the problem. I personally would go further and arrest those suspected of directly committing vandalism and battery. Lock them up. I would also hold the parents of underaged children legally accountable. No more excuses. 
We have to bring back reality, law and order, and force these youths onto the citizenship track. Otherwise, this social contagion will only spread to other communities and we’ll soon all be paying the price for our wayward youth.

Good morning,
Has everyone read this story about the dire wolves? Our friends at TIME have a great spread on this biotech startup, Colossal Biosciences, that used ancient DNA and CRISPR gene-editing technology to essentially de-extinct this species of giant wolf, which roamed North America until 10,000 years ago, feasting on horses and bison. The scientists, who must've only caught the first 20 minutes of Jurassic Park, are using this as proof of concept for bringing back more species from extinction, including the wooly mammoth and white rhino. We really are living in the future of our childhoods.
OK, I don't want to bore everyone with another vent session about the tariffs. I think it's an utterly misguided policy, as do a lot of other people far smarter than me. But my goal with this column is to make you think. To that end, I spent a big chunk of my evening casting far and wide for some more heterodox theories on the real strategy behind the tariff policy. Most of them are as dumb, but there is one idea making the rounds that—while I don't agree with it—at least made me use my brain.
The theory goes like this: it's all about China. Everything else is a smokescreen. The goal is not to punish a country like Vietnam, which we rely on for our Nikes, but to isolate China and its role in the global supply chain. The tariffs on uninhabited islands full of penguins are actually designed to ensure Beijing can't exploit any loopholes in getting around our trade barriers. Trump's big chart of numbers that freaked out the market was not designed to hold up to scrutiny, but rather to ""create leverage"" by shocking the world and getting countries to come to the table to negotiate, while inflicting both economic and psychological damage on China.
And many of those countries already have come to the table, at least according to the White House. But guess who hasn't? China, which is the only trading partner to respond to our tariffs with more of its own. The administration is betting, per this theory, that either China will back down because their economy badly needs access to our market (more than we need theirs, even). Or... it believes we are closer to a military conflict over Taiwan than anyone thinks, and the time to attempt to rebalance our trade and reshore as much industry as possible is right now—before Beijing blockades Taiwan (and its advanced semiconductors).
If you're looking for actual evidence that the strategy is to isolate China, here is some courtesy of this morning's WSJ: In order to avoid the tariffs on China, Apple is reportedly planning to send significantly more iPhones to the U.S. from its production facilities in India, which is a double whammy for China given how important the iPhone is to its manufacturing base and the fact that it's now losing that production to its biggest rival in the East.
Again, I don't really buy this argument—it feels like using a cruise missile to kill a mosquito—but it is at least rooted in Great Power theory. If you're interested in digging in, I suggest following this guy Henry Gao, an academic in Singapore who has been articulating this on X better than I could do here. But the questions I would ask the president's economic team, if I could ever get them to talk off the record, would be: if this is the plan, what is the purpose of antagonizing our other allies, who will we need to join us in this new multipolar order? How do you explain to the American people that the collateral damage being done to U.S. firms and equities is worth whatever grand bargain we might or might not strike with Beijing? Is there intelligence that China is closer to moving on Taiwan than we think...as in, it'll happen during the Trump presidency? Should we send the de-extinct dire wolves to a remote island financed by a kindly but misguided old man and his greedy lawyer?
A dissent by Justice Amy Coney Barrett in a case concerning President Donald Trump's use of a wartime-era deportation law has triggered a wave of backlash from prominent conservative commentators and supporters of the president. Barrett, appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump in 2020, joined the Court's three liberal justices in opposing the majority's decision to allow the administration to continue deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.

Donald Trump … [+4877 chars]","In modern American politics, most candidates, especially those seeking national leadership positions, tend to go out of their way to show respect and appreciation for the U.S. military. Donald Trump has long taken a dramatically different task, including during much of the 2024 campaign, when the Republican condemned his own country’s military leaders in striking terms.

Indeed, a month before Election Day, he said during an interview, “The military is bad. We have generals that do such a bad job.” In the same interview, Trump went on to complain that U.S. military leaders “never get fired.”

Evidently, he meant it. The Associated Press reported:

U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO’s military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, U.S. officials said Monday. Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force.

The AP’s account noted that Chatfield was notified of her ouster by Adm. Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the admiral that the Trump administration wanted to “go in a different direction.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly made the decision, and the AP report noted that it’s “unclear whether he received any direction” from the president.

While there’s ample precedent for military leaders being fired for cause, there’s no indication that Chatfield, a decorated helicopter pilot and the first woman to lead the Naval War College, did anything wrong or was falling short in her duties in any way.

So why was she removed from her post? According to The Washington Post, Chatfield had been targeted by a conservative group called the American Accountability Foundation, which lobbied Hegseth for her removal, pointing to a 2015 speech in which Chatfield said that “our diversity is our strength.”

And in 2025, such a sentiment is apparently beyond the pale.

The developments were not well received among Democrats on Capitol Hill. In fact, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, “Yet again, President Trump has fired a military officer serving in a role that is critical to maintaining U.S. national security and national defense with no explanation given for the person’s removal. ... The lack of information regarding VADM Chatfield’s removal is unacceptable, as is the apparent lack of planning for her successor.

“Yet again, our country is less safe because of President Trump’s actions.”

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, added, “Trump’s relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world.”

But as the dust settles on the Chatfield news, it’s also worth appreciating the degree to which this reflects an intensifying Republican purge of U.S. military leaders. Indeed, the admiral’s ouster comes just days after Trump also removed Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, who was both the head of U.S. Cyber Command and the director of the National Security Agency. Officials didn’t elaborate as to why Haugh had to go, but the decision followed a private meeting between Trump and a fringe conspiracy theorist who had some recommendations about the administration’s national security team.

Trump has also ousted Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of staff of the Air Force; Lt. Gen. Joseph B. Berger III, the Army’s top military lawyer; and Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer, the Air Force’s top military lawyer.

Of particular interest, however, is the president's apparent eagerness to target women in key military leadership positions. In fact, on the first day of the Republican’s second term, he fired Adm. Linda Fagan, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, evicting her from her home with three hours of notice. The fact that Fagan was a four-star admiral and the first woman to lead a branch of the military apparently meant very little to the president who ousted her.

The New York Times noted, meanwhile, that the same list also includes Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, and now, Chatfield.

Several weeks ago, five former defense secretaries — including retired Gen. Jim Mattis, Trump’s first defense secretary — condemned the administration’s military firings as “reckless.” Their joint letter, addressed to Congress, asked that the House and the Senate hold “immediate hearings to assess the national security implications” of Trump’s dismissals.

“Mr. Trump’s dismissals raise troubling questions about the administration’s desire to politicize the military and to remove legal constraints on the president’s power,” they said in the letter. “Talented Americans may be far less likely to choose a life of military service if they believe they will be held to a political standard.”

Trump appears to have ignored their concerns, and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have scheduled no such hearings.",Left

Here’s what to know today.

Trump holds firm on tariffs as White House looks to calm allies

After seeing wild swings in the market, Wall Street saw another day of declines as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs stokes global uncertainty. The volatile trading day was fueled, in part, by a false headline claiming Trump was considering pausing the tariffs.

Meanwhile, Trump yesterday threatened China with an additional 50% tariffs by tomorrow if it didn’t rescind its retaliatory measures — a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S. The White House later clarified it would mean 104% total against China. And early Tuesday, China vowed to “fight to the end” if Trump goes through with the additional tariff.

Through the volatility, Trump has made clear that he won’t back off on implementing the tariffs, even as some of his own supporters express confusion and worries about the policy. Administration officials said they are looking for ways to ease the concerns of wary supporters. That includes:

→ Deploying officials to speak to jittery business groups: Administration officials said they have been taking calls from business groups and setting up private meetings to allay worries.

→ Talking up the potential to cut deals with key trading partners: As the U.S. and China exchange threats, Vietnam, Cambodia, Israel and Poland are among the countries seeking trade agreements, according to the White House.

→ Suggesting tax cuts as a way to balance out the economic hit: But Republicans said they need to act fast if they want to coalesce around a budget resolution.

But mixed messaging isn’t working in their favor. Trump has called for his supporters to weather the storm, while the White House said it has no set period for how long the U.S. would endure a market strain. And when asked whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, Trump insisted “they can both be true.” Some Congressional Republicans haven’t shied away from calling out the administration on its inconsistent statements.

Supreme Court weighs in on Trump admin’s use of Alien Enemies Act for deportations

The Supreme Court threw out U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s decision to block the removal of men alleged to be members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador without any legal process under the Alien Enemies Act. The 5-4 ruling, with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining three liberal justices in dissenting, means the Trump administration can try to resume deportations under the rarely used wartime law, so long as detainees are given time to challenge their detentions and whether the Alien Enemies Act is being lawfully applied.

Both sides claimed a level of victory. Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X, said Boasberg was an “activist judge” who didn’t have the authority to overrule “President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy.” Lee Gelernt, lead attorney for the ACLU who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said it was a “big victory” that the Supreme Court demanded the government give detainees due process.

The Supreme Court’s decision, however, leaves various legal questions unanswered about the novel invocation of the 18th century law, including whether the Trump administration can even invoke it against gang members.

Trump administration considers drone strikes on Mexican cartels

The Trump administration is considering launching drone strikes on drug cartel figures and their logistical networks in Mexico as part of an ambitious effort to combat criminal gangs trafficking narcotics across the southern border, according to six current and former U.S. military law enforcement and intelligence officials with knowledge of the matter. The Trump administration has already been shifting military, intelligence and law enforcement resources toward combatting the cartels, but what it’s contemplating now could be unprecedented both in the number of U.S. personnel involved and in the use of American unmanned aircraft to bomb cartel personnel and assets.

The sources said discussions are still at an early stage and that the administration has made no final agreement. It’s unclear whether American officials have floated the possibility of drone strikes to the Mexican government, though the sources said it hopes to coordinate any action with Mexico’s military and law enforcement agencies. Most administration officials see unilateral military action as a last resort that could have big consequences.

Florida wins the NCAA men’s national championship

Florida defeated Houston 65-63, overcoming a 12-point deficit in the second half to win its first NCAA Tournament title since 2007. The back-and-forth comeback capped a tournament that otherwise lacked suspense, with last night’s title match coming down to the final possession. With 19 seconds left, Houston had possession of the ball but could not get a final shot.

Florida’s Will Richard scored 14 points in the first half to keep the Gators in the game early. Teammate Walter Clayton Jr. scored 11 in the second half and was crucial in the title-sealing defensive closeout with seconds remaining. Houston’s L.J. Cryer led the Cougars, scoring 19 points.

Staff Pick: Inside the mine housing millions of retirement records

Iron Mountain isn’t the name of a roller coaster ride. It’s a decommissioned limestone mine about an hour outside of Pittsburgh where, since 1960, the government’s Office of Personnel Management processes and stores documents of the 100,000 or so retirements from federal service each year. Now, this warehouse-like cavern 220 feet underground, which stores 400 millions records in 26,000 file cabinets, is a DOGE target for modernization.

President Donald Trump on Monday said the situation with Iran is entering ""dangerous territory"" as he announced his administration would be talking to Iran on Saturday.
While it's not yet known what the talks will achieve, experts continue to warn that time is running out to not only block Iran’s nuclear program but to utilize existing tools to counter Tehran’s dismissal of international law, a mechanism known as ""snapback"" sanctions.
""This is the one time that we have the ability to sort of put new sanctions on Iran where we don't need Russia and China's help, and we can just do it unilaterally,"" Gabriel Noronha of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America told Fox News Digital. Noronha is an Iran expert and former special advisor for the Iran Action Group at the State Department.
The ability to employ snapback sanctions on Iran expires Oct. 18, 2025, which coincides with when Russia will lead the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for its rotational one-month stint.

TRUMP, NETANYAHU TO MEET AT WHITE HOUSE AS ISRAEL SEEKS TARIFF RELIEF, DISCUSSIONS ON IRAN, GAZA HOSTAGES
The provision for snapback sanctions was enacted under UNSC Resolution 2231, which was agreed to just days after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 as a way to ensure that if Iran was found to be violating the nuclear deal, stiff international sanctions could once again be reimposed. 
The JCPOA has increasingly been considered a collapsed agreement after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 under the first Trump administration, followed by increasingly flagrant violations by Iran of the nuclear deal.
This has culminated in the rapid expansion of Tehran’s nuclear program and the assessment by the U.N. nuclear watchdog earlier this year that Tehran had amassed enough near-weapons-grade uranium to develop five nuclear weapons if it were to be further enriched.

European nations for years have refused to enact snapback sanctions in a move to try and encourage Tehran to come back to the negotiating table and diplomatically find a solution to end its nuclear program. 
Any participant in the JCPOA can unilaterally call up snapback sanctions if Iran is found to have violated the terms of the agreement. But the U.S., which has been calling for snapbacks since 2018, was found by the U.N. and all JCPOA members to no longer be legally eligible to utilize the sanction mechanism after its withdrawal from the international agreement. 
But as Iran continues to develop its nuclear program, the tone among European leaders has also become increasingly frustrated. 
France’s foreign minister last week suggested that if Iran did not agree to a nuclear deal and halt its program, then military intervention appeared ""almost inevitable.""

EXPERTS WARN IRAN’S NUCLEAR DOUBLE-TALK DESIGNED TO BUY TIME, UNDERMINE US PRESSURE
""Iran must never acquire nuclear weapons,"" Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot reportedly told France’s Parliament on Wednesday.
""Our priority is to reach an agreement that verifiably and durably constrains the Iranian nuclear program,"" he added.
It remains unclear how much longer European nations will attempt to hold out for discussions with Iran, as Trump has said he is becoming fed up with Tehran and has threatened direct military confrontation, even while he has made clear his administration's willingness to discuss a deal with Tehran.
With France serving as UNSC president in April and the bureaucratic red tape Russia could employ, UNSC members supportive of blocking Iran’s nuclear program must immediately call up snapback sanctions, Noronha said.
""It takes about six weeks to actually be implemented properly,"" said Noronha, author of ""Iran Sanctions, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, and the Path to Snapback,"" which was released last week. ""And second, because the distribution of the presidencies and leadership of the U.N. Security Council is weighted towards more favorable leaders right now in the spring before it goes to pretty adversarial leadership in the summer and fall.""

The expert said this is a rare moment for the UNSC, which in recent years has become increasingly ineffective in accomplishing major geopolitical wins because it is generally divided between the U.S., U.K. and France on one side and Russia and China on the other.
A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow’s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.

""This is the only time this has ever happened at the U.N. before,"" Noronha said. ""They basically said, when we invoke snapback, what it does is it says U.N. sanctions will automatically return unless there's a vote by the council to unanimously allow sanctions relief to remain on the books.""
The snapback mechanism would legally enforce all 15 UNSC member nations to reimpose sanctions on Iran, including Russia and any nation that may be sympathetic to Tehran.
If the snapback mechanism expires come October, the U.N.’s hands will likely be tied when it comes to countering Iran’s nuclear program, as it is unlikely any new resolutions on the issue will be able to pass through the council given the current geopolitical climate between the West and Russia.

Concern is growing among public health experts that anti-vaccine sentiment within federal and state governments may derail emerging and cutting-edge vaccines that are now awaiting regulatory approval in the United States – essentially leaving those vaccines in limbo.

Just last week, the US Food and Drug Administration delayed a decision on full approval of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine even though it was on track to be cleared, leaving many public health experts wondering why. A person familiar with the situation told CNN that the FDA is seeking more data on the vaccine, which has been available under emergency use authorization since 2022.

It was the first Covid-19 vaccine to come up for FDA action since the second Trump administration took office in January.

The surprise delay is casting new uncertainty on the fate of another vaccine awaiting FDA action: Moderna’s next-generation Covid-19 shot, called mRNA-1283, which is set for a decision by May 31.

The company has also filed for FDA approval of its flu+Covid combination vaccine, mRNA-1083. If approved, it will be the first in the US to offer protection against flu and Covid-19 in a single shot.

The quest for more efficient vaccines

Seasonal flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines are recommended each respiratory virus season, which comes over the fall and winter. These vaccines can be given at the same time, but they come in separate formulations and packaging. Vaccine makers have been developing shots that combine them in an effort to make vaccination more efficient.

Moderna intends to make all three vaccines – seasonal flu shots, Covid-19 shots and the new combination vaccines – available as it’s able, Dr. Rituparna Das, the company’s vice president of respiratory development, said in an email.

In June, Moderna released trial data showing that the combo shot, mRNA-1083, was safe and elicited higher immune responses against influenza virus and the coronavirus than currently licensed seasonal flu and Covid-19 vaccines in adults 50 and older.

“We are excited about the potential for 1083 as a combination vaccine that could improve protection against flu and COVID in a single shot,” Das wrote. “For the past several years, it has been these two respiratory viruses which caused challenges for hospital systems in the fall.”

Combination vaccines are already common in pediatrics, for instance, where the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is widely used and the DTaP vaccine can prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in a single jab.

And Moderna isn’t the only company developing a flu+Covid combination shot.

Pfizer and BioNTech have teamed up to develop an influenza and Covid-19 combination vaccine that uses mRNA technology, starting multiple clinical trials evaluating updated formulations. Novavax intends to seek a business partner to continue the research and development of its influenza and Covid-19 combination vaccine candidate, which is protein-based rather than mRNA-based.

“We know that significant market demand exists for a combination product, with greater than 60% of consumers stating a preference for an all-in-one option,” Silvia Taylor, executive vice president and chief corporate affairs and advocacy officer at Novavax, said in an email.

But when it comes to these new and emerging vaccines, there are mounting concerns that they may face the same fate as Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine: delayed regulatory action.

MRNA technology faces political attacks

Unlike Novavax’s Covid-19 shot, which uses traditional protein-based technology, Moderna’s mRNA-1283 Covid-19 vaccine and the flu+Covid combination vaccines being developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are mRNA vaccines. This means they harness a modified version of messenger RNA – a molecule that tells cells what to do based on the information contained in DNA – to direct cells to produce proteins that help the immune system recognize and defend against a particular pathogen: in this case, flu viruses and the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

MRNA technology is already used in Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s currently licensed Covid-19 vaccines, which have been found to be safe and effective.

There is growing concern among public health experts about whether anti-vaccine sentiments – as well as bills to ban shots that use mRNA technology – may block people from accessing not only a flu+Covid vaccine but any vaccine, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

“I absolutely believe the environment is ripe for more jurisdictions to pick up those kinds of pieces of legislation,” Freeman said.

“It is a dangerous way to go,” she said. “Low vaccination rates create the perfect environment for the spread of infectious disease.”

Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, also worries about anti-vaccine sentiments in politics as well as how mRNA vaccines specifically have been attacked.

“This is playing out now in some state legislatures that are trying to ban mRNA vaccines because of disinformation from the anti-vaccine lobby saying that they integrate into our DNA, that they cause turbo cancers, that they inflate the side effects,” Hotez said.

Lawmakers in some states have introduced measures to ban the administration of mRNA vaccines, such as Montana, where a bill was defeated; Iowa and Idaho, where measures have advanced to committee; and Texas, where bills are pending or under review.

At the federal level, the Trump administration is looking to evaluate mRNA research and technology and ensure transparency, according to an administration official.

The US Department of Health and Human Services has also asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study vaccines and autism, a person familiar with the situation told CNN in March, despite strong evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.

And Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, who was instrumental in the development and authorization of mRNA vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, was forced out of the agency this month.

At the National Institutes of Health, some officials reportedly have urged scientists to remove references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, suggesting that the agency might abandon that area of research, according to KFF Health News.

“Researchers have been exploring mRNA’s potential in medicine for over 30 years,” Moderna spokesperson Jenna Sexton said in an email, adding that more than a billion doses of mRNA vaccines have been distributed worldwide and “an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data” is well-established.

“Legislative efforts to ban or restrict mRNA medicines in various states are largely driven by misunderstandings about their well-established safety profile and mechanism of action,” Sexton said. “For example, while mRNA does not modify DNA, this misconception is frequently cited in support of such policies. If enacted, these measures could hinder important research and limit patient access to innovative treatments, potentially delaying life-changing medical advancements.”

This trend of lawmakers pushing to ban the use of mRNA technology is “striking” and suggests that scientists and doctors could do a “better job” of communicating with the general public, public health officials and lawmakers about the overall benefits and risks of mRNA medicines, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

“A complete ban on a technology would be a very striking move, as opposed to exploring a concern with a particular product. It’s like saying that there is something that you dislike about a website, so you’re going to ban the entire Internet,” Barouch said.

“MRNA technology is used for many things, not just infectious disease vaccines. There are cancer therapies that are being developed,” he added. “There’s gene editing and gene therapies that are being developed.”

Some public health experts argue that scrutiny around mRNA technology is an extension of anti-vaccine sentiments in politics.

“I think that was kind of a false notion that people had – that there’s hesitancy around the mRNA vaccine, and those people will get a protein-based vaccine. They didn’t,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

“They didn’t get the J&J vaccine very much when it was available, and they didn’t get the Novavax vaccine, which has been available since the EUA was issued,” he said. “You have to think about this as no vaccine being safe in this administration, in terms of from political interference.”

‘You only have to roll up one sleeve’

If a flu+Covid combination vaccine does eventually get FDA approval, it might help improve vaccination rates because “you only have to roll up one sleeve to get your vaccine, and you can get two at the same time and get good, solid protection as recommended,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

But he added that it could still take some time before combination vaccines are ordered and rolled out to the general public, as they would have to be licensed under the FDA and then recommended by the CDC as part of the routine seasonal vaccination schedule.

Most doctor’s offices, clinics, hospitals, health departments and pharmacies are gearing up to place orders for seasonal flu and Covid-19 vaccines for the 2025-26 virus season, as preorders typically begin around March, Schaffner said. The vaccines are usually delivered starting around August.

“The combination vaccines may or may not become available for this fall,” Schaffner said. “The ordering takes place months before we start administering the vaccine, and that, of course, allows the manufacturers to get a sense of how much vaccine to manufacture. So it’s a complicated process.”

Some vaccine experts argue that mRNA technology can speed up that process.

When it comes to the composition of flu shots, the use of mRNA vaccination against influenza “is still not well-established, except in experimental studies,” Hotez said, so using mRNA technology in flu+Covid combination vaccines “would establish proof of concept.”

“If that gets shown, that could be a big breakthrough,” he said. “Because it means that we could perhaps shorten the period required for making influenza vaccines as we get closer to flu seasons and have a better match between circulating viruses and the vaccine.”

The currently licensed seasonal flu shots, which are not mRNA-based, are developed months in advance because they’re updated each year to target whichever strain is expected to circulate the most, and they take some time to manufacture. By the time the vaccines are given, the flu strains they are updated to target may no longer be dominant.

“But you can make a piece of mRNA very quickly, and possibly closer to the actual fall-winter flu season,” Hotez said.

“As a result, you might be able to reduce the time frame required to make the decision on what goes into the flu vaccine,” he said. “With mRNA, we could delay that decision on what goes into the vaccine – maybe for a couple of months, until May or so – until we have a better idea of what’s circulating. So there could be some advantage there.”",Left

China on Tuesday slammed US Vice President JD Vance for his comments about “Chinese peasants” in an interview that has drawn widespread ire and ridicule on China’s internet – and comparisons with Vance’s own self-proclaimed “hillbilly” background.

Speaking to Fox News last Thursday, Vance defended President Donald Trump’s market-hammering tariffs and railed against the “globalist economy.”

“What has the globalist economy gotten the United States of America? And the answer is, fundamentally, it’s based on two principles – incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us,” Vance told news show “Fox & Friends.”

“To make it a little more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture.”

Asked about Vance’s comments at a regular news briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: “It’s both astonishing and lamentable to hear this vice president make such ignorant and disrespectful remarks.”

CNN has reached out to Vance’s office for comment.

Clips of Vance’s interview made their way to the Chinese internet this week, drawing an intense backlash in a country where factory floors are lined with industrial robots, cities are embracing homegrown electric vehicles and remote counties are connected by a nationwide web of high-speed railways.

“This true ‘peasant’ who came out of rural America seems to have a lack of perspective,” said Hu Xijin, the influential former editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times, in a post on microblogging site Weibo. “Many people are urging him to come and see China for himself.”

A hashtag on Vance’s remarks became the top trending topic on Weibo on Monday night. By Tuesday afternoon, it had racked up 140 million views.

“Look, this is their true face — arrogant and rude as always,” said a comment with 2,900 likes.

“We may be peasants, but we have the world’s best high-speed rail system, the most powerful logistics capabilities, and leading AI, autonomous driving, and drone technologies. Aren’t such peasants quite impressive?” another said.

Others noted the irony of Vance’s comments given his own working-class upbringing as depicted in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”

In the book, Vance chronicles a childhood plagued by poverty, abuse and his mother’s drug addiction and spent partly in Appalachia, a corner of the United States he felt had been forgotten by wealthy elites. The book by Vance – a venture capitalist before his foray into politics – caused a sensation after Trump’s first election win and was widely seen as an explanation for the billionaire’s rise among the White working class.",Left

In the year and a half since the horrific massacre of 1,200 innocents, the wounding of 5,000 and the kidnapping of 250 victims by the terrorists of Hamas on October 7, 2023, war has raged through and around Israel. It is closer to its end than it is to its beginning, but it rages still.
America’s early and strong support for the Jewish State faltered as President Biden’s cognitive impairment grew worse and more obvious. We do not know whether the former president’s infirmity impacted his original, resolute support for Israel by allowing the anti-Israel wing of his party to ascend within the West Wing or to worry his campaign’s guiding hands into advising him that appeasement of Iran and its forces was necessary to win last fall. Thanks to the new book ""Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House"" by NBC’s Jonathan Allen and The Hill’s Amie Parnes, however, we now know for sure that the divide between the U.S. and the equal of any of its allies on the planet widened and deepened as the months went by.
That very disturbing story was also alluded to by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview last week with Israeli journalist Gadi Taub. It wasn’t just the halt of a single shipment of 2,000 pound bombs. It wasn’t just Vice President Harris’s assertion that she’d ""studied the maps"" and Rafah could not be assaulted. It was a collective turn against Israel at every level of the Biden administration that should shock every friend of our ally.
TRUMP SAYS US WILL DEAL ‘DIRECTLY’ WITH IRAN IN HIGH-LEVEL MEETING ON SATURDAY
That has changed, of course, and President Donald Trump is at least the equal of any previous president in his resolute support for Israel. Which is a relief as Iran shows no sign of wanting to do anything but ""break out"" and build a nuclear weapon to add to its arsenal.
Israel’s destruction of most of Iran’s proxy forces in the region as well as of the Iranian air defenses which the enemy of the West thought extremely strong, but which proved very weak over the course of the war, has left Iran’s nuclear sites and oil refineries defenseless. The choice before Ayatollah Khamenei is stark. There is no public evidence that Iran’s ""Supreme Leader"" has dialed back his fanaticism and accepted President Trump’s invitation to peacefully abandon its nuclear ambitions, but we cannot know. Rogue states like Libya and apartheid-era South Africa chose to abandon their WMD programs. It’s not impossible that Iran will too. Unlikely, but not impossible.
What is impossible is to erase the record of who did what and said what over the course of what ought to be called the Israel-Iran War ""Sometimes a flare goes up and you get to see exactly where everyone is standing,"" Douglas Murray writes in his profound ""On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilization."" That flare went up on 10/7 and has never for a moment dimmed. Everything is on the record. The reckoning continues.
Murray painstakingly reminds the reader of a few of the awful atrocities of the 10/7 war crimes as well as retracing the instant arrival of apologists for the terrorists. It is a necessary, but troubling revisiting of the facts of the attempt to destroy Israel before he turns to the biggest question. Not even as indefatigable a reporter as Murray can do more than remind us of some of the terrible crimes, some of the victims, some of Israel’s many heroes.  What he does, elegantly, is set up the reader for the question that has haunted the world since 9/11: ""What can Western liberal societies do in the face of such movements"" as Hamas and Hezbollah and, of course, Iran.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Murray cannot provide an answer, but he does lead the careful reader to some measured optimism. The West can rally, can reject the death cults, can produce a new generation of warriors and patriots even as Israel has over 18 months.
It does not require persuading the useful idiots in the West who march and scream in defense of the totalitarian killers. ""Would there ever be any way to get into the heads of these students that this was not some kind of game?"" Murray asks after reviewing some of the most stupid slogans of the apologists of terror. It does not seem likely.
But it also does not seem all that necessary. The United States, Israel and the rest of the West contain within it deep wells of resolve to live freely and without fear, to defeat some enemies and deter others.

Journalists and public intellectuals like Murray arrive at the moments they are most needed, just as Murray has. ""Fearless"" doesn’t begin to describe how he has covered Israel’s trauma and its recovery and ongoing march towards a remarkable victory over the evil that surrounded it and overwhelmed it briefly. The cost has been so immense that it is sometimes difficult to recall that, through this long and often ghastly war, civilized people have rallied to Israel and will continue to do so. Indeed, there are signs now that the people of Gaza themselves are done with the butchers who have brought such devastation down on their heads. Lebanon too may be awakening, as did Syria, to the hope that the futures of their countries do not have to be mortgaged to the fanatics of Tehran.
The cost has been so very high and will grow higher still. Murray charts the reality that there is no choice but to confront and defeat the evil. It’s a book you should get and read and buy for family and friends. It is a riveting account and a profound assessment of where we have been and the choices we have to make. It should be a best-seller, proudly displayed on the table of anyone who stands for freedom and human dignity against the fanatics of our time.

Much has been made recently of the Democratic Party’s systemic problems. Donald Trump won the popular vote, Republicans netted a healthy Senate majority, and almost every demographic group, absent the white and wealthy, gravitated to the GOP. As Trump has laid waste to the government and cowed civil society, few Democrats could settle on a compelling oppositional message. It was obvious to many Democrats that the tactics of eight years ago — perpetual outrage, constant street protest — failed to curb Trump, but what to do instead? Many activists and members of Congress wanted Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to shut the government down in protest. Schumer refused; the base of the party collectively howled.

But while it’s true that Democrats still need to address many of their long-term challenges, like winning back the working class and getting competitive again in rural states, Trump has already catalyzed their comeback. The global economic meltdown triggered by his 1890s-style tariffs is lousy news for anyone with stock-market exposure, but it’s great for the many House Democrats campaigning in marginal seats next year. So is Elon Musk’s DOGE, which has proved so alienating that it fueled the Democratic blowout in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race last week and may have flipped Elise Stefanik’s North Country district, had Trump not decided to yank her nomination for ambassador to the United Nations. As wrong as James Carville often is these days, about American politics — the man was certain, at the end of October, Kamala Harris was going to win the election — he might have had a point when he advised, in late February, Democrats “roll over and play dead.”

His argument was unsatisfying, if straightforward and probably correct: Trump was in the process of damaging himself and the party, and Democrats should just get out of the way and let him do it.

It’s not as if Democrats have much of a choice. They’re locked out of power and Trump is happy to buck their lawsuits by ignoring what federal judges say. Protests don’t move him, either. And it’s not like Trump or Musk would have cared if Schumer failed to support a continuing resolution to keep the government open. A shutdown would have been a nice excuse to purge more federal employees.

But the good news for the opposition party is that Trump is still Trump. He’s not a diabolical genius or a political mastermind triangulating them into submission. He’s not even George W. Bush, who once enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings. He is reckless, and he can’t check his party’s worst impulses — or his own. Right now, in addition to tanking the stock market, Trump is actively encouraging Republicans in Congress to deliver him a budget-reconciliation package that would both slash taxes on the wealthy and gut Medicaid. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act were enough to trigger a backlash that powered a Democratic takeover of Congress. This time around, the ACA is largely safe, but Republicans seem deadly serious about harming the health-care program that covers 70 million working-class and poor Americans, many of them in GOP-run states.

Once Republicans take aim at Medicaid, the Democratic counter-message becomes simple: We will save you from chaos. We are the party of protecting health care and your 401(k). We are the party of making sure the VA and the SSA and the EPA still function. We can get you back to normal. On its own, this isn’t enough to guarantee Democrats a durable majority, but it is enough to claw back some of what they’ve lost. If the problem for Democrats, in the early 2020s, was that they had become too culturally left for the country — too insular, too faculty lounge — Trump has made voters forget much of that. He fully owns the sliding stocks; he is the face of American frailty.

There is a reasonable argument for tariffs and protectionism broadly. America should be a nation that builds. Industrial capacity must be restored. But Trump doesn’t have the patience for that. Endless trade wars won’t convince manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S., and there’s little Trump is doing to create the economic conditions that would spur a true domestic manufacturing renaissance. He is not harnessing the power of the federal government to back certain industries, as the Biden administration did; he has no vision for what comes after tariffs. Democrats can easily exploit this lack of vision. It’s not hard to imagine the 2026 backlash wave to Trump being larger than 2018’s. Democrats may not only win a House majority but approach margins on the scale of the Republican Tea Party wave of 2010. All of this, then, may lead to a reverse Tea Party year, a battle for government that enlivens ordinary people.

If Trump were wiser, he’d dial down his tariffs to the level of those implemented in the 2010s. He’d fire Musk tomorrow, unwind DOGE, and start to rehire the government workers he fired. He’d toughen the border without attempting to deport nonviolent green-card holders for holding political beliefs on Israel he doesn’t like. He would try to formulate an actual industrial policy to help the millions of people in the Midwest who voted for him, and he’d follow Republicans like Josh Hawley and try to implement a child tax credit. He’d adopt some of Steve Bannon’s big-tech skepticism. But Trump isn’t wiser, and he doesn’t know how to course correct. This is what his administration looks like and, on the merits, it’s a failure. Voters know this. It’s why Democrats are stumbling out of the wilderness.",Left

From diversity and gay rights to freedom of speech and protest, anti-Trump activists in New York shared their visions of an ""ideal America"" during interviews with Fox News Digital on Saturday, at the 'Hands Off!' protest movement.
""For me, an ideal America is one where people can protest like this and have their voices heard, and they are the ones who are running the country — not somebody who's taken over the country and no longer allows the First Amendment to be spoken,"" said one unnamed, masked protester, holding a sign which had the scientific symbol for ""resistor."" 
Another protester, Josh from Queens, echoed the sentiment about freedom of speech, saying in an ideal America, no one is concerned about their right to free speech.
""An ideal America looks like a country where its citizens can live in dignity, can live in peace and prosperity, where, yeah, we are not afraid to exercise our right to free speech, our constitutional given rights, where everyone ideally, is housed, is fed, makes a fair living wage,"" Josh told Fox News Digital.

Recent events, such as the case of anti-Israel student Mahmoud Khalil, continue to place the First Amendment in the spotlight, allowing the boundaries of free speech to continue to be redefined. 
The former Columbia University graduate student was arrested by ICE for failing to disclose his affiliation with a United Nations Palestinian relief agency. 
""To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,"" Trump is quoted in a fact sheet issued by the White House.
Others told Fox News Digital they are prioritizing social values, like diversity or LGBTQ+ rights. This includes May — a resident of Manhattan who says that her ‘ideal America’ includes diversity and peace. 
""Diverse, which is a bad word these days,"" May told Fox News Digital about her ideal America. ""Women have rights and freedom. And we live in peace."" 
Mary, a protester from Queens, added that her ideal America included ""civil rights, gay rights, enough food and health care for every single person, and the right attitude toward other countries, a helping attitude.""

The Trump administration has pushed back diversity mandates and woke ideology in federal agencies and education. The stated purpose of the pushback is to restore merit-based systems and reduce divisive identity politics.
DEI comes with a cost, including a price tag to taxpayers of nearly $2 billion nationwide due to mandates at public universities, according to the Goldwater Institute in a report shared earlier this year.
Some activists, however, still felt that it was the responsibility of the U.S. to give back to those that were considered underprivileged or to provide individuals with a social safety net. 
""Ideal America is [an] America that's going to give more rights to more people,"" said Yalena, who is from Ukraine and has lived in the U.S. for over three decades. 
""And those of us who have privilege, sharing that privilege. So, when we say MAGA, we say ‘Make America Great Again,’ and when we refer to again, it's a group of people that was privileged enough to be gaining from government and society, and what we're trying to do in the democratic world is to give more rights to people who are underprivileged,"" she said. ""I think this is the main thing. Am I privileged or am I underprivileged? And that's where we need to concentrate in the democracy."" 
Wendy, a professor living in New Jersey, said she was particularly concerned about cuts to higher education and science.  (Fox News Digital)
Wendy, a professor living in New Jersey, also shared that everyone should be provided a social safety net in her version of an ideal America. 
""An ideal America is one where everyone has a social safety net and can be successful in their jobs and make enough money, a living wage — to be able to take care of themselves and their families,"" Wendy said. 
In 2023, federal agencies estimated $236 billion in improper payments for social safety net programs were disbursed, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). That sum accounted for funds from 71 different government programs.

Discussions among White House, Defense Department and intelligence officials, which are still at an early stage, have included possible drone strikes against cartel figures and their logistical networks in Mexico with the cooperation of Mexico’s government, the sources said.

Still, the administration has made no final decision and reached no definitive agreement about countering the cartels. And unilateral covert action, without Mexico’s consent, has not been ruled out and could be an option of last resort, the sources said. It is unclear whether American officials have floated the possibility of drone strikes to the Mexican government.

If Mexico and the United States proceed together with drone strikes or other action, it would not be the first time they have launched a joint effort to take on the cartels, nor would it be the first time that American military and intelligence worked in concert with Mexico’s law enforcement and army.

But what the Trump administration is contemplating could be unprecedented both in the number of U.S. personnel involved and in the use of American unmanned aircraft to bomb cartel personnel and assets.

Administration officials and nominees have repeatedly refused to rule out drone strikes in public statements.

The U.S. military and the CIA have dramatically stepped up surveillance flights over Mexico to collect intelligence in advance of what is likely to be a major campaign against the cartels, which the White House has labeled a threat to national security, the six sources said. The flights are being carried out with Mexico’s approval, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said.

“They’re looking to build a target deck,” one of the former officials, who is familiar with the administration’s plans, said of the surveillance flights. The potential target list most likely could include cartel operatives, vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the gangs’ network, the sources said.

The White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.

After this article was originally published, Sheinbaum addressed it and the question of U.S. drone strikes at a news conference.

""We reject any form of intervention or interference. That’s been very clear, Mexico coordinates and collaborates, but does not subordinate itself. There is no interference, nor will there be,"" she said, according to a translation provided by the Mexican Embassy to the United States.

""While this idea hasn’t been formally proposed, we’ve made it clear that it wouldn’t address the root of the issue. What truly works is ongoing attention to root causes, arrests driven by intelligence and investigation, coordination, and zero tolerance for impunity. We categorically reject any such actions, and we don’t believe they will happen. There is a strong, ongoing dialogue on security and many other matters.""

Possible unilateral strikes

The administration has already been shifting military, intelligence and law enforcement resources toward combating the cartels, current and former officials said.

President Donald Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, refused to rule out unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned Mexican officials in private about possible unilateral U.S. action. Both have said variations of “all cards are on the table” when it comes to tackling the cartels.

According to a memoir by Mark Esper, who was defense secretary during Trump’s first term, Trump asked him in 2020 whether the military could fire missiles into Mexico to destroy drug labs and then deny the United States had conducted the strike. Trump and his aides have rejected Esper’s account as false.

The administration hopes to coordinate any action against the cartels with Mexico’s military and law enforcement agencies, the six sources said. They also said most administration officials see unilateral military action as a last resort that could cause a rupture with Mexico and jeopardize vital cooperation on immigration.

Staging a military attack on the cartels in Mexico without the government’s consent would arguably violate international law, though both Democratic and Republican administrations have argued that the United States has a right to defend itself from threats within a country that has lost control of its own security.

Advocates of using drones believe that if enough military pressure is placed on the cartels, they will decide that the cost is not worth the money they can make from fentanyl. But some experts and former U.S. officials who worked on counternarcotics are skeptical, arguing that drone strikes could prove to be merely symbolic or, worse, backfire politically for Mexican leaders and jeopardize further cooperation.

During Mexican President Felipe Calderón’s tenure from 2006 to 2012, the two countries embarked on a major campaign to strike at the cartels’ leaders, dubbed the “kingpin strategy.” American spy agencies provided intelligence, U.S. military teams trained elite Mexican commandos, and U.S. law enforcement agents worked alongside their Mexican counterparts.

Former officials and experts disagree about the results of the effort. Some former U.S. law enforcement officials maintain that it made real inroads and was cut short just as the cartels were weakening. The Bush and Obama administrations portrayed it as effective.

But targeting gang kingpins also created a vacuum and triggered a spree of intense violence among rival cartels. Once Calderón’s party was voted out of office, the joint operations with the United States ended and the government curtailed the Mexican military’s role in the counternarcotics fight.

Some supporters of the Trump administration, including the six current and former officials, argue that its refusal to publicly rule out unilateral U.S. military action, coupled with tariffs and other measures, could push Mexico to accept joint operations that it might have rejected in the past.

How far to go in targeting the cartels — including whether to use unilateral military action — is the subject of an ongoing debate in the administration, the six current and former officials said.

Mexico under pressure

Arturo Sarukhán, who was Mexico’s ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2013, said it seems U.S. unilateral military action in Mexico is now a live possibility for the first time since 1914, when the United States attacked and occupied the port of Vera Cruz.

“There is no doubt if there were unilateral action inside Mexico, this would put the bilateral relationship into a nosedive,” said Sarukhán, who is now based in Washington. “It would be put in a tailspin, as it would represent a violation of international law and an act of war.”

Sarukhán said he believes Mexico has undermined its own position by failing to come to grips with rampant drug trafficking over the past decade, creating conditions that tried the patience of its more powerful neighbor.

“At the end of the day, it’s Mexico’s failings and mistakes that have put us in this position today,” he said.

Sheinbaum, Mexico’s relatively new president, has shown a willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration on the border and in countering the cartels, current and former U.S. officials said.

Sheinbaum had already begun to step up enforcement efforts when she took office in early October, after years of a hands-off approach under former President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador, who claimed more than once that fentanyl was not produced in Mexico.

Sheinbaum’s decision to allow CIA surveillance flights during the Biden administration marked a significant change in Mexico’s stance, two current and two former officials said.

But Mexico remains sensitive to any perceived bullying or threat of domination by its larger neighbor, and Sheinbaum warned against any unilateral U.S. military action after Trump designated the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

“There has always been a tremendous level of suspicion by Mexican authorities of the U.S.,” said another source, a former American diplomat who served in Mexico and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personal observations about discussions between the two governments. “And we haven’t exactly given them reason recently to believe any differently.”

However, one of the six sources, who was a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official in the Biden administration, said pressure from the Trump White House already has pushed Mexico to take much tougher action against drug cartels after what he called “handwringing” by the Biden team. He said he believes fear of Trump could push Mexico to accept U.S. military action.

“Politics aside, Trump is not f------ around with this stuff,” he said, adding that Mexican officials may fear potential economic retaliation if they defy the Trump administration.

‘The gloves are off’

After Trump decided to declare six Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations, U.S. intelligence agencies and military units now have sweeping legal authorities to conduct espionage and covert operations targeting the criminal networks in Mexico and beyond.

Derek Maltz, a career DEA agent now serving as its acting head, told NBC News that the designation has opened up a host of new tools and that it is something he has been advocating for many years.

Ideally, he said, the United States would secure agreement from the Mexican government before any military strikes against cartel infrastructure.

“It’s their country, and obviously we believe in strong partnerships,” Maltz said. “That said, at some point it’s about the safety of our kids.”

In Phoenix, where, the DEA says, 60% of the fentanyl that reaches the United States first arrives, DEA Special Agent in Charge Cheri Oz said that the last few months have been a breath of fresh air in the struggle to stem the flow.

“The gloves are off,” she said in an interview for “NBC Nightly News” last month. “I think what we’re doing right now is working, and I think in a few months, we’re going to start seeing, really, the rewards from our efforts.”

Maltz said there has been “historic, unprecedented action” working with Mexico on drug enforcement in the first few months of the Trump administration.

Mexico last month sent 10,000 troops to its northern border, where they are searching vehicles for fentanyl as they cross.

Also last month, Mexico extradited 29 people alleged to be drug traffickers to the United States, including Rafael “Rafa” Caro Quintero, who was convicted of masterminding the kidnapping and murder of a DEA agent in the 1980s but was released from Mexican prison in 2013. He was re-arrested in Mexico in 2022. His handover has deep meaning for DEA agents.

It is difficult to measure progress in the war on fentanyl at any moment in time. Overdose deaths fell 24% in the year that ended in September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that has largely been attributed to awareness of hidden fentanyl and to Narcan treatment, and tens of thousands of people in the United States are still expected to die by fentanyl this year.

Seizure numbers fluctuate, but law enforcement officials say most of the fentanyl smuggled into the United States is not discovered, despite DEA statistics showing 125 million pills containing fentanyl seized in the Phoenix division along since 2016.

What gives officials hope right now, the current and former DEA officials said, is intelligence suggesting that Mexican cartels are off balance.

Oz, the DEA chief in Phoenix, said intelligence shows cartel leaders are unsure how to respond to the improved cooperation between the United States and Mexico and the increased pressure on their operations.

“They’re scrambling right now,” Oz said. “There’s a lot of disorganization amongst the cartels.”

Past battles and skepticism

Dating to the 1980s, American presidents have turned to law enforcement agencies, the CIA and the military to work with Mexican authorities to battle cartels. But the results have been mixed and often marked by recriminations in both countries.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on narcotics trafficking at the Brookings Institution, said building U.S. cooperation with Mexican law enforcement remains the most promising approach to get at the cartels. She said she believes interrogating key figures in the gangs’ networks would be more productive than drone strikes.

“Dropping bombs is seductive but accomplishes not very much and comes with enormous risk,” she said.

Some former diplomats and law enforcement officials are skeptical that fentanyl trafficking can be significantly curtailed through military action. They argue that there is no silver bullet and that the solution has to include close collaboration with Mexican authorities, scanning equipment at border crossings, cracking down on money laundering and enlisting the help of private companies that produce chemicals used to make the drug.

The drug is so concentrated and portable that it does not require the large-scale logistical networks associated with plant-based drugs, experts said.

“You’re talking about something that a person could put in the trunk of their car,” said Annie Pforzheimer, a former senior U.S. diplomat who worked on counternarcotics.

Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, said the Trump administration would be likely to struggle to find suitable targets for drone bombing raids.

The cartels do not operate large pharmaceutical labs to produce fentanyl; instead, they use “nothing more than a metal tub,” with chemicals mixed with a shovel or a long stick, Vigil said. Most of the smugglers ferrying the fentanyl across ports of entry are U.S. citizens, who easily move back and forth across the border.

“It’s not a military problem. It’s more of a law enforcement problem,” Vigil said.

But a former U.S. military officer with experience in the region believes the cartels are likely to pull back from fentanyl smuggling if they come under relentless attack and will look for a way to do business without provoking a U.S. reaction.

“Cartels are not terrorist organizations,” the former military officer said. “They are not ideologically aligned; they are not religious. They don’t want to die for their job.”",Lean Left

Thailand’s arrest of a prominent American academic on charges of insulting the monarchy has “alarmed” the United States, the State Department said, in a rare case of a foreign national allegedly falling foul of the kingdom’s strict lese majeste law.

Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in central Thailand who writes analysis on the kingdom’s military and politics, could face years in prison after he was formally charged and detained when he presented himself to police and appeared in court on Tuesday.

Thailand has some of the world’s strictest lese majeste laws, and criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence for each offense. Anyone can file a lese majeste complaint and sentences for those convicted can be decades long, with hundreds of people prosecuted in recent years.

Chambers’ lawyer, Wannaphat Jenroumjit, said a warrant for his arrest was issued last week after a complaint was filed by a regional army command. Alongside lese majeste, Chambers is also facing charges under the Computer Crimes Act.

“He was accused of publishing a blurb on (Singapore’s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies’) website in connection with an ISEAS webinar in October 2024 about military reshuffles,” said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, advocacy lead for Thai Lawyers for Human Rights and part of Chambers’ legal team.

“He denied all charges. He neither wrote nor published the blurb on the website,” Akarachai said.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s court appearance, Chambers told CNN he had been told little about why he was charged and feared he “could be imprisoned for 15 years.”

Chambers was released on bail early Thursday after multiple bail requests were earlier denied. He is barred from leaving the country and Thai authorities have revoked his work visa.

Chambers is a scholar, author and lecturer at Naresuan University’s Centre of ASEAN Community Studies, and frequently contributes insights to news articles on Southeast Asia, including to CNN.

Advocates say the charges pose “a grave threat to academic freedom in the country.”

“Unlike other lese majeste cases, this case involves an extremely well-established academic whose work focuses very deeply on the civil-military relations in Thailand and whose expertise is widely acknowledged within the academic community,” Akarachai said.

The US Department of State said on Tuesday it was “alarmed” by Chambers’ arrest and is providing consular assistance.

“We are in communication with Thai authorities regarding this case,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a statement. “As a treaty ally of Thailand, we will closely monitor this issue and advocate for the fair treatment of Paul Chambers… We have requested access to him to ensure his well-being and to provide any necessary support.”

Thailand’s conservative, military-backed establishment has ruled the country on and off for decades, and critics say it routinely uses laws like lese majeste, sedition, and the computer crimes act to silence criticism and opposition.

The military has long had an outsized influence over the country’s politics, despite Thais repeatedly voting overwhelmingly in support of the military’s political and progressive opponents. It has staged 13 successful coups since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, the latest in 2014 that ushered in just under a decade of military or military-backed rule.

Longest sentence: 50 years

Last year, a Thai appeal court extended a man’s prison sentence to a record 50 years for insulting the monarchy, in what is believed to be the toughest penalty ever imposed under the lese majeste law.

The charges against Chambers represent a “tightening chokehold on free speech and academic freedom in Thailand,” said Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher for Human Rights Watch.

“Paul is considered a major target by ultra-royalist groups, which have launched multiple attacks against him for years — ranging from online disinformation and hate campaigns to pressing authorities to revoke his visa and get him expulsed from the university,” Sunai told CNN.

It is rare for a foreign national to be targeted by lese majeste. In 2011, Thai-born American Joe W. Gordon was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for insulting the monarchy after posting a link to a biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, that he was involved in translating, which was banned in Thailand. He was later released after receiving a royal pardon.

For years, human rights organizations and free speech campaigners have said the law has been used as a political tool to silence critics of the Thai government.

And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since 2020, when nationwide youth-led protests saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms – for the first time openly criticizing the monarchy, and publicly questioning its power and wealth.

Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol, who had reigned for seven decades.

Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership in 2023, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.

The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until the end of January 2025, at least 1,960 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with at least 277 prosecuted for lese majeste.

One of the most prominent of those is Arnon Nampa, a Thai activist with a cumulative sentence of 18 years in prison for a raft of lese majeste and other charges relating to his advocating for monarchy reform during the 2020 protests.

A much-anticipated bill that would offer amnesty for those prosecuted in politically motivated cases will be introduced to Thailand’s parliament on Wednesday. However, there is ongoing debate as to whether lese majeste will be included in the bill.

The high-profile nature of Chambers’ case could mean it backfires on the military and have wider impacts on Thai society, some analysts say.

“The cost to the Thai military is high because it will attract the kind of international attention and scrutiny the army wants to avoid,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.

“This case tightens the lid on academic freedom, and will reinforce the closing of Thai minds and undermine the intellectual and research ecosystem necessary to foster ideas and innovation to propel the Thai economy forward.”

A second national ""economic blackout"" is being organized by the People's Union USA, a group that says it wants to ""take power back from the corporations,"" between April 18 and 20. During this time, the group is urging its supporters to avoid spending money if they can, and only use local businesses if they need to.
Newsweek contacted the People's Union USA for comment on Tuesday via email outside of regular office hours.
The People's Union USA has already organized one nationwide ""economic blackout,"" which took place on February 28, whilst it has an ongoing Walmart boycott which lasts until April 14.
This comes after thousands of people across the U.S. and beyond took part in hundreds of anti-Trump demonstrations organized by the ""Hands Off!"" movement on Saturday. These indicate the Trump administration and its agenda could face growing opposition from campaign groups using protests and boycotts, rather than electoral politics, as their main tools.
The second ""economic blackout"" organized by the People's Union USA takes place from April 18 to 20, during which the group is asking Americans to carry out ""no spending"" and ""no big box shopping"" if they can, and if they need to spend to ""support local businesses only.""
The People's Union USA claims it is fighting corporations and politicians who ""have worked together to rig the system against the American people"" with ""an economy designed to exploit workers.""
It also opposes the rolling back of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives which has taken place across the private sector since Trump's election victory in November and in the federal government since his second inauguration in January. The group says: ""The idea that DEI initiatives should be abandoned is backward, regressive, and dangerous.""
The People's Union USA is led by John Schwarz, an activist with 409,000 Instagram followers who also uses the name ""theonecalledjai.""
Further boycotts are planned by the group including one targeting General Mills from April 21 to 28 and a second aimed at Amazon from May 6 to 12.
Speaking to Newsweek, Schwarz said: ""The second economic blackout on April 18th, 19th, and 20th is about one thing, power. The power of the people to say enough. We're raising awareness not just for our organization, but for the larger truth that most Americans already feel...and that is these corporations do not pay their fair share in taxes. They exploit families, crush small businesses, and continue to profit off inequality and economic control.
""This blackout is a peaceful, powerful reminder that we are the economy. Without our spending, without our participation, these systems don't move. We're not asking for chaos, we're asking people to think, to step back, and to realize how much power they already have. The more people who stand together, the louder the message becomes. It's time they understand, the people are organized, awake, and no longer willing to be ignored.""
On its official website, The People's Union USA says: ""Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers, and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits. Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible.
""Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires, and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent. The system has been designed to keep us powerless, but that ends now.""
Speaking to Newsweek before the People's Union USA's first ""economic blackout,"" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, said: ""We've seen economic protests like this before when changes were made to different major employers that were controversial, and this planned one is no different...
""While these blackouts are normally done with the hope of positive implications, the reality is past data indicates they lead to little financial data from most major companies. At the end of the day, even if consumers support the cause, they're going to continue to fulfill their purchasing needs and desires.""
It is unclear how many people will participate in the People's Union USA's upcoming boycott. Given the size of the corporations being targeted, support for the boycott will have to extend well beyond the regular activist community for it to have a significant economic impact.

After President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting criminal migrants throughout U.S. communities, one Florida city’s showdown with the governor has created a ripple effect throughout the Sunshine State. 
Last month, a Fort Myers City Council meeting spiraled into chaos as officials sparred over a provision allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to train local law officers to identify criminal aliens and aid in deportation. 
ICE’s 287(g) program aims to facilitate partnerships between the federal agency and local cities throughout the country. 
City officials in Fort Myers initially failed to pass the program on a 3-3 vote, with one member not in attendance, following a heated meeting that left two members in tears.

""I was embarrassed for our city,"" Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told Fox News Digital. ""I believe the residents of our city want leadership that is strong, can listen to the difficult issues and make decisions."" 
Voicing their opposition on the record, council members Darla Bonk and Diana Giraldo became visibly upset as they denounced the program. 
""It is a tumultuous day and age, and this is a day I hate to be in this seat,"" Bonk said, as she noted the risk of Fort Myers losing state and federal funds. ""But my city is not for sale.""
""I can't stand behind this as an immigrant, the only immigrant sitting [on] this council,"" Giraldo said.
Members of the Fort Myers City Council were not immediately available for comment.

(Jonah Hinebaugh/The News-Press/USA Today Network-Florida)
State officials took note of the city’s apparent hesitation to enact the program, with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier penning a letter to the city council demanding it walk back its position or risk legal action. 
Uthmeier said that by failing to enact the program, Fort Myers had inadvertently declared itself a sanctuary city, which is prohibited under Florida law. 
""Failure to correct the Council’s actions will result in the enforcement of all applicable civic and criminal penalties,"" Uthmeier wrote. 
Suddenly, Fort Myers was thrust into the national spotlight as Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration waited for officials to make their next move, threatening the loss of state and federal funds. 
‘PROMPT REMOVAL’: TRUMP DHS EXPANDS EXPEDITED DEPORTATION POWERS AS OPERATIONS RAMP UP

""Under this 287(g), we’ve said all jurisdictions in Florida must assist with immigration enforcement,"" DeSantis said during an immigration enforcement discussion at New College of Florida, two days after Fort Myers failed to approve the agreement. ""You saw this thing where the city council’s fighting the mayor and the police chief about whether [the] Fort Myers Police Department should be involved in it."" 
DeSantis went on to say that, under Florida law, each county and municipality within Florida must enter an agreement with ICE. 
""The last thing you want is to have the governor and the attorney general at odds with your city,"" Anderson said. ""I felt that we did create a de facto sanctuary city.  That’s not the message we want to send. [Our] message is that we are a law-abiding community and we don’t tolerate criminal behavior.""
FLORIDA SHERIFF SAYS ICE PARTNERSHIP ONLY THE BEGINNING IN ILLEGAL MIGRANT CRACKDOWN

Days later, the city council called for a special meeting and, in a stunning about-face, voted unanimously to pass the memorandum. 
In response to Fox News Digital’s request for additional information, the DeSantis administration referred to Communication Director Bryan Griffin’s social media post crediting the city’s reversal to DeSantis ""insisting that the legislation passed in [a] special session includes authority to remove local officials who refuse to actively participate in immigration enforcement."" 
Anderson believes the city council ultimately made the right decision.
""Our first responsibility is the protection and safety of our community,"" Anderson told Fox News Digital. ""We are not bringing national politics, or even state politics, in to do this. We are focused on our level on how we keep this city safe and growing."" 
The Fort Myers Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

But the high-profile showdown between Fort Myers and the DeSantis administration was enough for other cities within Florida to turn to the courts for clarity, fearing the possibility of legal retribution if local officials did not choose to enter into an agreement with ICE. 
In response to Uthmeier’s warning to Fort Myers, the city of South Miami, located in Miami-Dade County, filed a civil lawsuit asking for clarity regarding officials’ obligations to sign an agreement with ICE. 
""The Commission is concerned about potential impacts resulting from the agreement as it relates to liability, insurance coverages and collective bargaining agreements,"" Commissioner Steve Calle said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Given these concerns, the City seeks to determine whether signing the agreement is a legal obligation or if it can continue supporting ICE operations under existing state law, as it currently does.""
STATES FIRE BACK AGAINST ‘SANCTUARY’ RESISTANCE AS THEY RALLY AROUND TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS

The lawsuit claims the Florida Police Chiefs Association (FPCA) has repeatedly sent out emails ""encouraging municipalities"" to implement the 287(g) agreement under the direction of FDLE Executive Director of the State Board of Immigration Larry Keefe, with subject lines increasing in urgency from ""Green Alerts"" to, most recently, ""Red Alerts."" 
""Many of the emails include listings and statistics as to which agencies have executed 287(g) agreements, with the implication that future ‘Red Alert’ emails may contain listings of agencies who have yet to sign 287(g) agreements,"" according to the lawsuit. 
FPCA and Keefe did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. 
Despite pushback from some cities throughout the state, other sheriffs' departments are falling in line, looking to meet the DeSantis administration and their local communities in the middle. 
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has vowed to implement a more ""targeted"" approach while complying with the 287(g) program.

""We have been working with ICE for 10 to 12 years, so this is nothing new to us,"" Bradshaw told Fox News Digital. ""It’s just formalizing the program, because we had an agreement with [ICE] anyhow. We even had an office in the jail for an ICE officer before the Biden administration canceled all that stuff.""
Bradshaw is taking aim at criminal aliens throughout Trump’s home county of Palm Beach, focusing his efforts on those who are a danger to the community in an area with a large migrant population without doing immigration sweeps. 
""It’s not mass deportation, it’s targeted deportation,"" Bradshaw said. ""It targets gang members, MS-13, Tren de Aragua, cartels, people that are wanted on warrants for felonies or if we arrest somebody who has committed a crime. It is not immigration sweeps – we don't do that, we won't do it. This is strictly after the bad guys in the neighborhoods.""

Currently, 39 states have at least one active agreement in place, with four facing restrictions due to state law, five states with no active agreements and one with pending agreements, according to ICE. 
Under an executive order issued by Trump during his second term, ICE is required to authorize state and local law enforcement officials to perform the duties of immigration officers ""to the maximum extent permitted by law."" 
In February, DeSantis directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), Florida Highway Patrol (FHP), Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and the Florida State Guard to comply with the 287(g) deportation functions. Additionally, all 67 of Florida's counties have signed agreements with ICE, but the future of municipalities within the state remains unclear.

""[ICE] values our ongoing working relationship with various Florida law enforcement agencies and recognizes the continued importance of sharing information and coordinating operations with state and local law enforcement partners in a way that best serves local needs and fulfills ICE’s important national security and public safety mission,"" ICE said in a statement to Fox News Digital.  
While uncertainty regarding the future of the program continues to cloud the Sunshine State, local officials who remain in lockstep with the Trump and DeSantis administrations believe ICE’s 287(g) program is the answer to keeping their cities safe from criminal aliens. 
""We’ve got to find a way to clean this mess up,"" Anderson told Fox News Digital. ""For decades, the can has been kicked down the road. We have got to get firm and [figure out] how we make this work.""

Japan has said that while its relations with Russia are difficult, it intends to conclude a peace treaty with its maritime neighbor over the Northern Territories dispute.
The dispute over the Russian-controlled Kuril Islands dates back to World War II.
On Tuesday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry reiterated its commitment to a peace treaty with Russia in its 2025 edition of the Diplomatic Bluebook.
Newsweek has contacted Russia's Foreign Ministry for comment by email.
A peace treaty formally ending World War II has never been signed by Russia and Japan, largely because of disputes over a group of Russian-occupied islands claimed by Japan.
At the end of World War II, the USSR seized the Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and Habomai islands of the Kuril Islands chain. Tokyo claims the islands as its ""Northern Territories,"" and the issue has strained relations between Russia and Japan for decades.
Lying between the large Japanese island of Hokkaido and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, the islands' location offers a number of military and political benefits.
The latest version of the Diplomatic Bluebook, an annual report on Japan's foreign policy, said the Northern Territories issue remained the country's ""biggest concern"" regarding bilateral relations with Russia.
The Japanese government ""remains committed to the policy of resolving the Northern Territories issue and concluding a peace treaty,"" according to the document.
The Russian Foreign Ministry, which has maintained its territorial control over the islands, has refused to negotiate with Japan on the matter ""in light of the measures taken by Japan in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""
Russia halted peace talks with Japan after Tokyo imposed sanctions on Moscow following the launch of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
""Furthermore, Japan has lodged protests with Russia regarding Russian moves to strengthen its military presence, including military exercises, in and around the four northern islands and their surrounding waters, which it considers to be unacceptable and contradictory to Japan's position regarding these islands,"" the Diplomatic Bluebook said.
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the latest version of its Diplomatic Bluebook: ""The Northern Territories are islands over which Japan has sovereignty and are inherent Japanese territory but are currently under the control of Russia. The Japanese government has been persistently pursuing negotiations under the policy of resolving the issue of the ownership of the Northern Territories and concluding a peace treaty.""
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in April 2024: ""Japan has fully joined the practice of illegal sanctions and restrictions against our country and has taken an unfriendly position towards us.""
Russia has not officially responded to Japan's renewed commitment to peace negotiations.",Center

Lisa McClain: Michigan Auto Workers 'Encouraged' by Tariffs' Long-Term Job Growth Goal,"Workers in Michigan automobile plants are ""actually encouraged"" by President Donald Trump’s status quo-altering tariffs despite short-term uncertainty, according to Rep.

Lisa McClain (R… [+2951 chars]","WASHINGTON, DC — Workers in Michigan automobile plants are “actually encouraged” by President Donald Trump’s status quo-altering tariffs despite short-term uncertainty, according to Rep. Lisa McClain (R-MI), who told Breitbart News that people are “willing to make that trade off for long-term more jobs.”

The state’s ninth congressional district, which McClain has represented since 2023, is home to many auto workers employed at nearby plants, including Stellantis’s stamping plants in Warren and Sterling.

Both of those locations are gearing up for temporary layoffs as the auto giant pauses production at some of its assembly plants in Mexico and Canada, including just over the border in Windsor, Ontario, due to Trump’s tariffs, the Detroit Free Press reported.

The Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram Trucks maker is the fifth-largest employer in the state, with 38,913 jobs as of August 2024, according to CBT News.

When asked what her constituents are saying about the current instability in the automobile industry, McClain said that it has only been “about 15 percent of what I’m hearing.”

“I thought it would have been worse, to be honest with you, actually. A lot of the union, a lot of the rank and file, are actually pretty patient because they believe [in the] long term … They are actually encouraged, because they think it will bring more jobs,” the chair of the House Republican Conference stated.

Noting that Stellantis’s Warren plant experienced layoffs in former President Joe Biden’s last few months in office due to electric vehicle (EV) mandates, McClain argued that the workers are “more optimistic” now because “they believe that [tariffs are] going to get more manufacturing done at their plant.”

Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs last week from the White House Rose Garden, taking the “They charge us, we charge them” approach to foreign trade.

The congresswoman also argued that there would not be “any issues” with Stellantis plants in Mexico and Canada if they abide by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a free trade agreement proposed by Trump during his first term and signed by former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto and former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.

“My frustrating part is — tell both ends of the story. And there’s two, there’s two sides to the story,” McClain continued. “I mean, we have to be honest. It isn’t an immediate fix, and there is going to be some discomfort, whether it’s uncertainty or whether it’s the players that aren’t agreeing with the USMCA — actually having to adhere to it now, or paying the price.”

“But I think people are willing to make that tradeoff for long-term more jobs, because let’s not forget — in Michigan, we’re getting our lunch handed to us on jobs leaving the state of Michigan,” she added, noting that the state lost a congressional seat because of it.

According to McClain, her constituents are viewing the tariffs through a “different lens” — one that puts the goal of bringing back jobs into perspective.

But even as the president, administration officials and key allies say he will not back down from his tariff plan, they are looking for ways to ease the concerns of wary supporters. The measures include talking up the potential to cut deals with key trading partners, pointing to tax cuts as a way to balance out the economic hit and deploying officials to speak to jittery business groups.

Follow live politics coverage here

“The feeling among Hill Republicans is we’ve got to get rolling on the tax cuts right now,” a senior Senate Republican aide said. “We have to offer some candy to the business community in terms of offering them certainty and helping with pro-growth policies.”

Two administration officials confirmed that members of the administration were taking calls from business groups and setting up private meetings to allay worries.

“The Trump administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans, especially about major policy decisions like President Trump’s reciprocal tariff action,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making, however, is the best interest of the American people — such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.”

The tariffs — which could quickly become the defining policy of his second term — put two core Trump identities in conflict: the protectionist who spent decades calling for steeper tariffs to combat what he sees as the country’s being ripped off by its trading partners, and the deal-maker, the persona he spent years building in New York real estate and as the protagonist of “The Apprentice.”

“Nobody but me would do this,” Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. “You know, it would be nice to serve a nice, easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade.”

Allies push back

Markets have not been fans of resetting the table. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had smaller dips Monday as administration officials talked up dealmaking and a misleading headline briefly led investors to believe Trump was pausing the measures. Since Wednesday, when Trump announced his tariffs — which were calculated using a widely derided formula based on U.S. trade deficits with other countries — the Dow and the S&P 500 have both declined by more than 10%.

Trump’s billionaire backers and business executives are sounding the alarm. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Trump’s tariffs will weigh down the economy and raise prices. Bill Ackman, the outspoken Trump supporter and billionaire hedge fund executive, railed against the policies in a series of social media posts over the weekend, calling on Trump’s advisers to revise their tariff formula “before the President makes a big mistake,” suggesting all capital gains will be wiped out in 2025. Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports and a vocal Trump supporter, readied for a turbulent day for markets Monday that he proclaimed “#orangemonday,” a not-so-thinly veiled shot at the president.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles made at least one phone call over the weekend to an associate asking about the level of concern in the private sector about the market downturn, according to a person close to the White House.

Another member of the business community who seems displeased by Trump’s tariff agenda is Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has been Trump’s right-hand man in rapidly slashing government programs and workers. Musk promoted free trade and went after Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, saying Navarro “ain’t built s--t.” He also also laughed at at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s explanation for the administration’s placing tariffs on an uninhabited island.

A senior White House official, who insisted Trump’s team is not worried about cracks forming in the coalition, said, “Elon is entitled to his own opinion.”

Against that backdrop, Trump started his Monday calling for supporters to weather the storm.

“The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”

A White House official stressed Monday that the president and the White House have no set period for how long they would endure the market strain, emphasizing that offering such a timeline would open Trump up to additional criticism should they continue past it.

But administration officials, including Trump, spent the last few days touting how many countries are calling them up to cut deals to avert or lower the new tariffs, with multiple officials touting outreach from 50 countries.

“They’re offering things to us that we wouldn’t have even considered asking for,” Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.

The White House official named Vietnam, Cambodia, Israel and Poland as countries seeking to quickly come to agreements.

Both Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday praised a call with Japanese officials to negotiate an agreement while criticizing China for quickly retaliating against Trump’s new measures. Trump has threatened further escalation with China if it does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs by Tuesday, saying he will impose an additional 50% tariff on top of what he has already proposed.

There is a universe where the Trump administration ramps up a trade war with China while cutting deals with other countries. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally and former top White House official, said Monday the trade war would soon focus much more on China.

China “dared to cross Trump with retaliation after they had been warned,” Bannon said. “The Trade War they have been pursuing for years against America is now going to get hot. Isolated from the world, this is a war China can’t win.”

‘The markets don’t scare him’

The White House and the president himself continue to offer mixed messaging about their game plan. Asked Monday whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”

Other administration officials have been more insistent that the tariffs are coming regardless of any negotiations. Lutnick said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “there is no postponing” the new tariffs, claiming it will soon be a reality that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing, is going to come to America.”

“They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,” Lutnick said of the measures.

Asked about Vietnam in an interview Sunday on Fox News, Navarro said, “This is not a negotiation.” On Monday, he told CNBC that Vietnam’s offering to reduce its tariffs to zero “means nothing to us, because it’s the non-tariff cheating that matters.”

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said more clarity about the tariffs from Trump “would help a lot.”

“Some of the president’s aides are saying we need to do this to raise money; other aides are saying we need to do this to make other countries pay us back for ripping off America through unfair trade,” Kennedy said. “Others have said it’s good news because many countries want to lower their tariffs, in some cases to zero, which I happen to think is good news. They’re just all over the map.”

“I think it would be better if they would talk to their boss and find out what the message is,” he added. “It’d actually be better if some of them would shut up, but that’s not likely to happen.”

A senior Senate GOP aide who supports Trump’s effort to reorient global trade reiterated that congressional Republicans “don’t really know what’s going on.”

“This is what he’s wanted to do his whole life,” this person said. “And he does not care. He truly believes this and wants to correct it. The markets don’t scare him. He’s just going to push through.”

The White House sought Monday to promote support of his policy, highlighting comments from groups like the United Auto Workers and the National Council of Textile Organizations.

“I think there’s some who believe in what he is doing and the need for short-term pain to address long-standing trade imbalances and some who think this is pure chaos with no real thought behind it,” said a Republican strategist who has worked with the White House previously. “Corporate world is frustrated with the lack of clarity. Political world is frustrated that he and the White House have not made their case in a consistent enough way.”

Congressional unrest

On Tuesday and Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will testify before the Senate and House about Trump’s trade policy. In his opening remarks Tuesday, he plans to tell senators that Argentina, Vietnam, Israel and other countries have already indicated they will reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers to come to agreements.

Although seven Senate Republicans have already signed on to a bill that would curtail Trump’s tariff powers — a bill he pledged Monday to veto if it is passed — two Republicans who spoke with NBC News said House Republicans are more nervous about the tariffs than their Senate counterparts. Those rank-and-file Republicans are starting to panic about the markets and want more guidance from the White House about Trump’s long-term strategy.

During a House GOP conference call Sunday, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, asked whether they could get a detailed briefing from the White House on tariffs, according to two people on the call. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told members that he would talk to Trump and vowed to arrange for someone in the administration to brief the conference, the sources said. They added that Johnson counseled members during Sunday’s conference call to just trust the tariff process and stand by Trump’s trade policy, arguing he helped deliver a strong economy during his first term.

But there are some signs of anxiety even among GOP leaders. Johnson has argued, both in a “Dear Colleague” letter over the weekend and on the conference call, that they need to quickly coalesce around a budget resolution — which Republicans need to unlock Trump’s tax and spending cut package — because of the market turmoil.

“There is a fork in the road as to what’s going to happen,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on his podcast Monday. “If President Trump uses this moment as leverage, he’s got an extraordinary opportunity to lower tariffs of every country on Earth to U.S. goods and lower our own tariffs in response. … On the other hand, there are voices in the White House that want high tariffs forever. There are angels and demons sitting on President Trump’s shoulders. Who does he listen to? I hope he listens to the angels.”

Stephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, said Trump must more effectively target his tariffs. Ultimately, the end game should be to negotiate new trade agreements.

“At the end of the day, the only solution here that I can see is for the other countries to start making those phone calls to the Oval Office and making some deals with Trump,” he said.

Trump spent the past weekend golfing at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, providing plenty of material to critics who said he was not taking the market downturn seriously.

A person who was at the LIV Golf Tournament said the tariffs and the market downturn were not front and center.

“It is not something that was much of a topic of conversation,” the person said. “I think there was sort of a storm cloud over it to some degree. I mean, people in the room were aware, no doubt, but it was just not the forum to bring it up, and it’s not like the sort of people who were going to bring up bad news or try and check Trump.”

Democratic activists organized large, nationwide protests Saturday opposing his administration, at which some protesters held signs decrying the impact of his policies on their 401(k) investments.

A White House official told NBC News that Trump was not concerned about the optics of golfing amid the economic turmoil.

This person said Trump’s golfing during the market strain was like “going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,” adding that he can enjoy his time in Florida while continuing to work when needed on weekends.

The official then expressed what administration officials are confident of — for now.

“The economy will be fine,” this person said.",Lean Left

As President Donald Trump’s new tariffs shook global markets and sent foreign leaders scrambling this weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago with a message.

It was imperative to get the administration’s tariff communications aligned, Bessent told Trump, and more focused on the endgame for Americans: better trade deals with foreign nations, according to people familiar with the conversation.

The risk in not doing so would be further market turmoil, Bessent conveyed.

The meeting was an example of the conflicting narratives swirling around Trump — with some corners pushing an effort to make deals and calm the markets. But five days after his splashy Rose Garden tariff announcement, foreign leaders and US investors alike are all still looking for clues of how willing the president is to negotiate down the duties. And as those outside observers pore over interviews and remarks from Trump’s constellation of economic advisers, it has not been clear what it will take to end the global trade war.

Delegations from US trading partners large and small were preparing to seek out American officials or plan trips to Washington to try and ascertain exactly how to remove the new duties. Offers were already coming in from some of the world’s largest trading blocs. The European Union, for example, offered to drop tariffs to zero on automobiles and industrial goods.

In all, 70 countries had approached the US administration to discuss trade issues in the wake of the new tariffs, administration officials said late Monday.

Whether any of that outreach works remained an open question, with significant ramifications both for the global economy and American consumers. Mixed signals from Trump and members of his economic team on Monday offered little clarity on how and when relief might appear.

One fact that did seem clear was Trump’s willingness to weather whatever political or financial fallout occurs in the near term as the new tariffs take effect later this week. Instead of endorsing an off-ramp, he said he was willing to further ratchet up tariffs on China if that country’s retaliatory tariffs remain in place.

Bessent has been one of the most visible proponents of Trump’s tariffs, and has ensured there is little daylight between himself and the president on the plan to apply the new duties. At the same time, he has also voiced the view that countries can and should seek out the administration for new trade agreements — a position the president himself took Monday after his meeting with his Treasury secretary in Florida, which was first reported by Politico.

After a morning telephone call between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Bessent announced that Trump had tasked him and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with opening new negotiations with Japan meant to “implement the President’s vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.”

Yet at the same time, both Trump and his aides suggested those talks are not expected to yield results immediately.

Other advisers continued to insist the conversations over tariffs were not “negotiations” at all, but rather a more permanent way to realign global trade.

In describing Trump’s approach, advisers said he was hoping to milk the United States’ trading partners for everything he can get, and that doing so will likely take time. Because every country is different, those negotiations will be tailored to Trump’s direct conversations with them, those advisers said.

“Everyone is desperate. If you have a desperate partner you can get a lot more, in the long run,” one White House official told CNN, adding that dozens of countries are coming to the table with options for how to best move forward and that Trump “will choose the best deal he can make to ensure we’re getting fair rates and bringing down the deficits.”

The official added that for now, the White House expects other countries to bring them their best offers — and only then will Trump be willing to deal.

A second Trump administration official told CNN that one of the highest priorities for the president is to work out deals that will erase America’s trade deficit with other countries.

Still, some officials behind the scenes believe that Trump should work out some deals sooner rather than later to put wins on the board to show the American people his tariff plan is working, and to further restore confidence in their overall message encouraging Americans to be patient, people familiar with the talks said.

“You need to instill hope in people who are watching their 401ks dwindle and the stock market crash. They need to do something to convince them to hold on a little longer and buy them the time they need to work this out,” a person close to Trump told CNN.

Some of Trump’s wealthy supporters, such as billionaire investor Bill Ackman, publicly denounced the president’s actions on tariffs, but others remained silent Monday as the turmoil continued on Wall Street.

In interviews, some advisers to billionaire donors urged patience to see how Trump’s moves would play out, noting they could result in negotiations that would significantly lower the tariff rates imposed by other countries. Some indicated they were more focused on their own priorities in Washington and not inclined to risk those goals by public feuding with the administration.

Divergent positions from the administration

But in the span of Monday afternoon, the administration offered divergent positions from different corners of the president’s team.

Just as Bessent posted on social media about leading negotiations with Japan, trade adviser Peter Navarro published a new opinion article in the Financial Times, staking out a firm line against easing off the tariffs and declaring, once again, “This is not a negotiation.”

Speaking at a Washington think tank, another of Trump’s top economic advisers acknowledged there were a variety of viewpoints.

“There are conflicting narratives because everyone’s got an opinion,” said Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, during a speech at the Hudson Institute. “That’s fine. Disagreement is how you can avoid group think.”

Still, the “conflicting narratives” emanating from the White House have also generated confusion on Wall Street and in foreign capitals. An erroneous report on social media Monday morning suggesting Trump was open to a 90-day pause on the new tariffs sent markets sharply higher, only to drop again after the White House denied it as “fake news.”

Later in the Oval Office, Trump affirmed he wasn’t looking at a pause in the new tariffs. And he suggested deals to remove the new duties wouldn’t happen quickly.

“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them,” Trump said. “They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”

He went on to deny any disconnect in the messages his team has been conveying, on either the permanence of the tariffs or whether he was open to negotiations in bringing them down.

“They can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs and they can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who left Washington without any guarantee from Trump that the 17% tariff he announced on Israel last week would be lifted.

A Maryland federal judge on Friday told the Trump administration to comply with a Supreme Court order ""in good faith"" regarding the ordered return of an alleged MS-13 gang member erroneously deported to El Salvador. 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, was deported to El Salvador last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member. His attorneys have maintained that he does not have any ties to the violent gang. 
In a Friday hearing, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to provide daily updates as they comply with Thursday's Supreme Court order upholding her previous order to return Abrego Garcia to U.S. soil. 
FEDERAL JUDGE HAMMERS DOJ ON WHEREABOUTS OF ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBER FOLLOWING SCOTUS ORDER
""I hope you will, in good faith, comply and we’ll take it from there,"" Xinis said Friday. ""I want daily updates until this matter is resolved.""
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign and Xinis made clear during the hearing that they did not agree on their understanding of the high court's order. 
On Thursday, the Supreme Court wrote that Xinis' order ""properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""

The high court also said the ""intended scope of the term ‘effectuate’"" in Xinis' order is ""unclear, and may exceed the District Court’s authority.""
""For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,"" the Court wrote. 
""It's going to be very difficult for the parties and for the trial court to understand what the scope is of the Supreme Court's order once the trial court takes the issue back up,"" defense attorney Phil Holloway told Fox News Digital.

Holloway said that the ambiguity in the high court's order could lead to the case ending up in the justices' hands again for further clarification. 
""The government is going to say that they are operating in good faith to comply with an order from the Supreme Court that is murky, and they're trying their best to comply with it,"" he said. ""At the same time, the president's trying to exercise his executive authority under Article II, which also the Supreme Court said the lower court must recognize.""

Holloway said the government can take various routes as it moves forward, including seeking a reprieve from Xinis' order and arguing that it is ""unduly burdensome, and it hinders the president's executive authority.""
""I think they may wind up trying to get him out of that prison and sending him to a different location,"" Holloway said. ""But I think they're going to fight pretty hard on whether they actually have to bring him back to U.S. soil.""

Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University and a Fox News contributor, said that the extent of the district court's power to order the government to comply with the Supreme Court's order is also in question. 
""It's entirely unclear what, if anything, the court can do beyond other than nudge the administration in this direction,"" he said.

Heritage Foundation Legal Fellow Hans von Spakovsky specifically pointed to the Supreme Court noting that the district court must give ""[d]ue regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs."" 
""So while the government has to act in good faith to use diplomatic efforts to negotiate Garcia’s return and keep the district court informed of its efforts, the district court cannot give the government direct orders on how to accomplish this foreign policy task or penalize the government if it is not successful,"" von Spakovsky said.

""The assumption is that if the court determines that the administration is acting in bad faith, it could take some other action,"" Turley noted. ""The question is, how do you make that determination?"" 
Turley said the district court could hold the government in contempt if it determines the administration acted in bad faith. However, enforcement may be challenging, given Abrego Garcia is overseas and the president’s Article II authority over foreign affairs.

The US Army’s base in El Paso, Texas — Fort Bliss — has been chosen as a site to detain and house potentially thousands of migrants, and contracts have already been signed to start the construction of migrant facilities on the base, three defense officials told CNN.

The US Army has now taken control of contracts supporting the construction and maintenance of the facilities on Fort Bliss, as well as a contract to oversee a central processing center in El Paso, the officials said.

Those contracts were originally awarded to private entities by US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The current plan for Fort Bliss is to build facilities that can hold as many as 5,000 migrants, one of the defense officials said.

“Regarding ICE building a facility on Bliss, I can say that the Secretary of Defense has authorized the US Army to assume control and management of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts supporting the facility construction, maintenance and upkeep at the CBP El Paso Central Processing Center and on Army land at Fort Bliss,” another of the defense officials said.

While the facilities will be on US military property, Army personnel will not be manning them due to laws barring military personnel from engaging in law enforcement activity. ProPublica reported earlier on Friday that ICE had awarded a contract to a private company to operate a migrant detention camp on Fort Bliss.

CNN has previously reported that officials were looking at using US military bases to house migrants instead of Guantanamo Bay, where the administration has been periodically sending migrants before moving onward to their final destinations.

It is unclear if Fort Bliss would be used instead of Guantanamo Bay, or in addition to the naval base. Fort Bliss has previously been used to temporarily house migrants, including during the surge of unaccompanied migrant children under the Biden administration.

Fort Bliss was also used to house thousands of Afghan nationals during Operation Allies Welcome, an initiative launched under the Biden administration to support and resettle more than 11,000 Afghans after the US pulled troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.

The Trump administration’s effort to deport migrants to Guantanamo, meanwhile, has run into significant hurdles. The administration first took the unprecedented step of sending migrants to Guantanamo Bay on US military aircraft in February, sparking fierce backlash from immigrant advocates and prompting a lawsuit from immigrant advocacy groups.

The administration had to pause building tents for migrants on the island last month because they did not have air conditioning or electricity and were not meeting ICE detention standards.

Conditions at the Guantanamo Bay facilities broadly have come under scrutiny. Some detainees have refused meals, which has led to weight loss, the US military officer overseeing the task force in charge of detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, Lt. Col. Robert Green, said in court documents. Green also said a restraint chair was used six times on February 28 — each time because of Venezuelan detainees who were engaging in self-harm.

As of mid-March, the administration had already spent roughly $16 million on the Guantanamo operation, according to Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, who visited the base as part of a congressional delegation visit.

“What we saw really was that there is very low capacity there, and it’s really expensive, and I could see no operational reasons for using Guantanamo Bay for immigration detention,” Jacobs told CNN last month. “It was clearly just because Donald Trump liked the optics.”

Maine officials said Friday the state will not comply with a ban on transgender athletes in high school sports in the wake of a Trump administration finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing the students to participate.

The US Education Department said in March that an investigation concluded the Maine Department of Education violated the federal Title IX law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls’ teams. The investigation followed a public disagreement between Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump at a February meeting of governors.

The US Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning on March 31, telling the state it needed to comply with the law in 10 business days or face enforcement from the US Justice Department. That deadline arrived Friday, and the Education Department said it referred its investigation to the DOJ for further enforcement.

Maine and the federal government are at an impasse, as the state will not sign a resolution proposed by the Trump administration to resolve the disagreement by banning the transgender athletes, said Maine Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster in a letter to the Education Department.

“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” Forster’s letter stated. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”

Trump has said the state risks losing federal funding if it does not come into compliance. Friday, the Education Department said it was also taking steps toward the termination of Maine’s education funding.

“The Department has given Maine every opportunity to come into compliance with Title IX, but the state’s leaders have stubbornly refused to do so, choosing instead to prioritize an extremist ideological agenda over their students’ safety, privacy, and dignity,” said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights. “The Maine Department of Education will now have to defend its discriminatory practices before a Department administrative law judge and in a federal court against the Justice Department.”

Federal funding is critical to Maine schools. Maine got $358 million in federal funding for K-12 schools in 2021-22, or 10% of its budget, according to data from the Census. About 13% of that money went to Title I, 14% to special education and 20% to child nutrition programs such as school lunches. Title I provides supplemental financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families.

Almost half of federal funds were simply marked as “other,” which likely points to the substantial Covid-19 relief funds schools got that year. Prior to the pandemic, Maine got 6% of its funding from federal sources, almost $185 million in 2018-19.

The issue of school funding and transgender participation in sports in Maine began to bubble up when Mills and Trump sparred over the subject during the February meeting at the White House. During the meeting, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports.

Mills responded: “We’ll see you in court.”

Soon after, the Education Department and the US Department of Health and Human Services launched investigations into the state.

Health and Human Services officials said in March that the Maine Department of Education, Maine Principals’ Association and a high school are each in violation of Title IX because of the participation of transgender athletes. The Health Department has already referred the issue to the DOJ for enforcement in court.

The principals’ association and school district both said they would not comply with a proposed agreement to ban the athletes.

Maine Republicans, who are in the minority in both houses of the Legislature, have put pressure on state Democrats to resolve the investigations. House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, speaking during a news conference, said Mills has created a “hostage situation” that jeopardizes federal funding.

“The governor, and her administration, is holding Maine schools and Maine education under hostage,” Faulkingham said. “This standoff is not going to end well for the state of Maine and its education funding.”

LGBTQ+ rights groups in Maine have defended the state’s approach. “We’re not giving in, and we’re not giving up on our trans community,” EqualityMaine said in a social media post.

Federal authorities have also said they are investigating Maine due to claims school districts in the state violate federal law by withholding information about students’ gender transitioning from parents.",Left

Trump's tariffs collide with a key campaign promise

By Kristen Welker

One of President Donald Trump’s central campaign promises focused on bringing down high prices and providing relief to voters who were struggling to make ends meet.

It’s an issue that helped him win. The economy was the top issue for voters in November, according to exit polls, and voters who said inflation had caused them and their families “a severe hardship” backed Trump by a wide margin.

“When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that,” Trump told me last December. “We’re going to bring those prices way down.”

But now, the president is acknowledging that Americans may feel some economic pain from his sweeping tariffs.

“We think we’re doing very well,” Trump told reporters yesterday. “Again, there’ll be a transition, cost, and transition problems, but in the end it’s going to be — it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”

Several Trump supporters who recently spoke to NBC News said they are willing to endure higher prices in the short term if it means reviving American manufacturing and fairer trade in the long term. But others are beginning to raise concerns that the president has abandoned his key campaign pledge to bring down costs.

Trump was already on shaky ground on economic issues before the latest tariff moves. An NBC News poll in March found a majority of voters disapproved of his handling of the economy, and a plurality (46%) said they were “not at all satisfied” with how Trump is battling inflation.

So how long will Americans give Trump to bring prices down? And how will they react if prices go up as a result of his tariffs?

We’ll delve into the latest on Trump’s tariffs on “Meet the Press” this Sunday with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Ray Dalio, founder and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund.

More on Trump's tariffs:

✉️ Mailbag: How imposing — and eliminating — tariffs can affect prices

Thanks to everyone who emailed us this week! One reader wrote to ask if we could expect to see prices that rise to due to tariffs come back down if those tariffs are reduced or eliminated in the future:

“Once prices go up, what are the chances prices will revert back to their pre-tariff costs? I can’t imagine companies not just adding the adjusted cost back to their bottom line. They may reduce prices some, but not all.”

To answer that, we turned to senior policy reporter Shannon Pettypiece, who has been covering the ins and outs of Trump’s tariff plans. Here’s her response:

As this reader and others might have noticed, prices for most of the things we buy rarely go down. Generally, that’s a good thing — having a healthy rate of inflation of around 2% is usually a sign of a growing economy, while widespread drops in prices can be a sign the economy is struggling.

But when it comes to tariffs, there isn’t a lot of good data on what happens to prices once a tariff is lifted, because it’s extremely rare for a tariff to be removed once it’s put in place. Trump’s tariffs from his first term, for example, were continued by President Joe Biden, and some companies are paying tariffs that were put in place decades ago.

A lot of factors beyond tariffs go into setting a price paid by consumers, like the costs of labor, transportation and raw materials. That also makes it difficult to determine how much prices will go up from tariffs. If tariffs cause the U.S. economy to slow down, that could mean lower oil prices and depressed wages, which could offset some of the higher costs from the tariffs.

So it’s necessary to take the entire economic picture when looking at prices. Even if a tariff were removed from an item, if other costs are going higher, there might not be a noticeable change to the price once the tariff is removed. As the reader notes, companies can also try to keep the added revenue from the higher prices to increase their profit margin — but that’s only if the consumer is willing or able to pay the higher price or they aren’t undercut by a competitor.

4 lanes in the (very early) shadow 2028 Democratic primary

We’re not even 100 days into Trump’s tenure, but key Democratic leaders are already scoping out different potential paths back to power in a few years.

As Ben Kamisar and Alexandra Marquez note, the party is at a crossroads, with its image slipping to historic lows after the November election and lacking significant power in Washington to push back against Trump and the GOP.

It’s against that backdrop that Democrats are making early, yet important, moves about how to position themselves as the party looks toward a wide-open 2028 presidential race.

We grouped them into four categories.

Grab a slice of conservatives’ pie: California Gov. Gavin Newsom; Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Colorado Gov. Jared Polis.

Resist Trump at all costs: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

Head down and govern: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.

Charting their own paths: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Rep. Ro Khanna of California; former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

A Maryland federal judge lambasted government attorneys Friday during a hearing over efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, from a prison in El Salvador. 
Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported to El Salvador last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member. His attorneys, however, have maintained that he does not have any ties to the violent gang. 
U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned DOJ attorney Drew Ensign as to Abrego Garcia's whereabouts after the Supreme Court upheld Xinis' order that federal officials must coordinate his return back to Maryland.
Xinis asked Ensign where Abrego Garcia was, and under ""whose authority,"" to which Ensign responded, ""I do not have that info.""

""I do not have that knowledge, and therefore I cannot relay that info to the court,"" Ensign said. ""They have not provided that confirmation before this hearing.""
The judge was unsatisfied with the government's answer. ""I’m not asking for state secrets. I’m asking where one man is,"" Xinis responded. ""The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: ‘Where is he?’""
After Ensign again said he did not have the information on hand, Xinis said, ""That is extremely troubling.""
In a Thursday order, the Supreme Court noted that ""The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal."" 
DOJ ASKS TO DISMISS VIRGINIA CASE AGAINST SALVADORAN ACCUSED MS-13 LEADER SET TO BE DEPORTED
The high court proceeded to say that Xinis' order ""properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""
Ensign made clear during the Friday hearing that the government intended to comply with the Supreme Court's order. When asked what had been done thus far to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Ensign said it was ""unclear.""
""That means they haven’t done anything,"" Xinis responded.

Xinis and Ensign engaged in a back-and-forth over their reading of the high court's order. Ensign said the government had understood the order to require that it must ""hear what the executive branch says in a brief.""
""We read the Supreme Court’s order differently,"" Ensign said. ""It said deference to the executive branch.""
Xinis, instead, said her reading was that the government take all the necessary steps to facilitate the return as soon as possible.
""I hear you and disagree,"" Xinis responded.

Xinis proceeded to request daily updates as the case continued ""from a person with direct knowledge,"" saying she would be issuing an order that delineated the request. 
""My message, for what it’s worth is, if you can do it, do it tomorrow. I don’t understand why it can’t be done,"" Xinis said. 
Ensign noted that he thought the orders were ""impractical"" but reemphasized that the government would be complying with the Supreme Court's order.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked to weigh in on the matter during a Friday briefing in light of El Salvador's president visiting the White House next week.  
""The Supreme Court made their ruling last night very clear that it's the administration's responsibility to facilitate the return, not to effectuate the return,"" Leavitt said. 
""The District Judge made clear that she’s not going to let the government continue to play games while a man’s life is at stake,"" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, counsel for Abrego Garcia, told Fox News Digital. ""They need to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and until then, they need to provide meaningful status updates showing their progress in doing so.""
Abrego Garcia was arrested in Baltimore on March 12 after working his shift as a sheet metal apprentice. The complaint states that he had also picked up his now-five-year-old son, who has autism and other disabilities, from his grandmother’s house before his arrest.

Abrego Garcia had initially fled El Salvador to escape gang violence, according to court documents. Beginning in 2006, gang members ""stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion.""
He eventually entered the United States illegally in 2011 and began living in Maryland with his brother, who is an American citizen.

In theory, the experts at the Elon Musk–helmed Department of Government Efficiency are reviewing federal-government operations and getting rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse,” along with any policies inconsistent with Donald Trump’s directives, in order to reduce federal budget deficits and public borrowing. By now, it’s clear there isn’t much actual “reviewing” going on. Instead, DOGE is following the Silicon Valley model of “moving fast and breaking things,” hoping to strip the bureaucracy down to the studs and then let Trump’s people figure out what’s next. DOGE is relying heavily on stealth and terror to put the fear of God, or of Musk, in nearly every federal employee or contractor, good, bad, brilliant, lazy, or indifferent. There’s no telling how much productive work for the American people is not being performed as the public sector reels from the chaos DOGE has deliberately induced.

So is all this disorder, distraction, and pain worth it? Musk’s own claims of likely DOGE “savings” have steadily dropped from his original (and hallucinatory) $2 trillion estimate to today’s $150 billion. But more important, is the bigger object of slowing the growth of federal spending being achieved? According to a new and damning report from The Wall Street Journal, the answer is an emphatic “no”:

Federal spending is higher since President Trump took office even as the Department of Government Efficiency slashes contracts, cuts jobs and ends diversity programs.

A Wall Street Journal analysis of daily financial statements issued by the Treasury Department found government spending since the inauguration is $154 billion more than in the same period in 2024 during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

That’s partially because one big chunk of federal spending, for interest due on existing debt, obviously can’t be cut. And other big chunks, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, have been placed off-limits to Musk for the time being and have automatic spending escalators built in. Defense spending, another big chunk, is an area in which Team Trump most definitely wants to spend more. But even where DOGE has been very active, the results are not impressive:

Federal salary payments are $2.8 billion higher than a year ago in part because of a Biden-approved 2% pay raise in January. Additionally, thousands of other employees who took buyout offers remain salaried through September.

There is a chance that the buyout offers actually increased salary costs this year, said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the left-of-center Budget Lab at Yale. Some employees who had planned to retire or leave the federal government may have instead accepted a buyout and remained on payroll.

In a section of the report entitled “Small DOGE Wins,” the Journal has some revealing data on how DOGE does wring dollars from the deep state:

Spending by the Transportation Security Administration nearly flatlined for several weeks in February and March. Since Trump took office, the agency spent $22 million less in part by delaying spending on new uniforms, as well as curtailing travel and training costs, said Joe Shuker, a regional vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees TSA Council 100. In March, the Department of Homeland Security canceled the union contract that protected TSA airport security workers’ benefits.

A TSA spokesman said spending is also down because of a pause in paying invoices until a system for reviewing them is in place.

So DOGE disrupted the agency responsible for keeping air travel safe and efficient by (a) abrogating an existing employment contract and (b) not letting TSA pay its bills. That’s what, in practice, “a pause in paying invoices,” which is happening in a lot of other federal agencies too, really means. Uncle Sam is welching on contracts and stiffing creditors. What a great example of genius management! And with such impressive results!

The more we watch DOGE, the clearer it becomes that reduced federal spending and budget deficits aren’t the point (recall that the administration is demanding a $5 trillion increase in the debt limit to accommodate its tax-cut agenda). The object of all this chaos and cruelty is political and cultural, not economic or budgetary. It is to turn the federal government into a terrorized instrument of Trump’s will with salaries and fat federal contracts being freed up to reward MAGA loyalists, who in turn have the opportunity to enjoy the torment and ruination of their presumed enemies in the public sector. Forget about “savings.” As Adam Serwer once said about Trump’s immigration policies, “The cruelty is the point.”",Left

The Department of Homeland Security requested the Social Security Administration to enter more than 6,000 names of immigrants into its database used to track dead people, according to a DHS official with knowledge of the decision.

The move will effectively financially starve the immigrants, cutting off their ability to legally work in the country, receive various government benefits and access financial services like credit and bank accounts. The Trump administration is hoping it will drive them to self-deport, according to the official. It’s all a part of the administration’s efforts to crack down on migrants in the country.

The move, first reported by The New York Times, targets immigrants who have Social Security numbers and may have entered the United States under programs that have ended, like the Biden administration’s temporary work programs.

A White House official told CNN the immigrants in question are temporarily paroled on the terror watchlist or have FBI criminal records and are ineligible to receive Social Security benefits. But the official did not provide any further evidence to support that claim. “Effective April 8, 2025, CBP terminated parole for all these people with written notice to each of them,” the official said.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, the government is finally doing what it should have all along: sharing information across the federal government to solve problems,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “Information sharing across agencies is essential to identify who is in our country, including violent criminals, determine what public safety and terror threats may exist, scrub these individuals from voter rolls, as well as identify what public benefits these aliens are using at taxpayer expense.”

Another source with knowledge of activities at SSA tells CNN the DOGE leaders there have now renamed the database previously known as the Social Security Death Master file to the “Ineligible file.”

The announcement drew sharp criticism from the former SSA commissioner, Martin O’Malley, who served under former President Joe Biden.

“If they can, contrary to the law and every regulation and without any due process, mark people inside SSA’s database dead who legally entered the country and were legally required to be issued a work SSA number, then they can do that to anybody,” O’Malley told CNN.

White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement: “President Trump promised mass deportations and by removing the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come and stay, we will encourage them to self-deport. He is delivering on his promise he made to the American people.”

Immigrants receive Social Security numbers when they are authorized to work legally in the US. These numbers are crucial for them to land employment.

The agency, however, has recently made it more difficult for immigrants to obtain numbers and cards by requiring them to go to field offices to get the documents instead of having them issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The change was first reported by Popular Information and confirmed to CNN by a former Social Security official.

Also, Elon Musk has claimed without evidence that immigrants are abusing the system and improperly receiving Social Security numbers. He claimed that Democrats are trying to use the program to lure immigrants and tip voting in favor of their party.

Senate Finance Committee ranking member, Democrat Ron Wyden whose committee oversees Social Security said the move takes away earned benefits.

“Declaring a Social Security number as dead is nearly impossible to undo, doubly so now that Elon Musk and DOGE have eviscerated customer service at the agency. This action raises the prospect of the Trump Administration stealing legally earned Social Security benefits from American citizens, further proof that Trump’s promise to protect Social Security is a lie.”

CNN,Alex Marquardt,US and Iran to begin critical nuclear talks as Trump threatens war | CNN Politics,Iran and the United States will begin crucial talks on Saturday to reach a new nuclear deal in an effort to ease tensions and avert another conflict in the Middle East that could further engulf the wider region.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/politics/us-iran-nuclear-talks/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/02-gettyimages-2203660315.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2025-04-11T18:57:27Z,Iran and the United States will begin crucial talks on Saturday to reach a new nuclear deal in an effort to ease tensions and avert another conflict in the Middle East that could further engulf the w… [+7249 chars],"CNN —

Delegations from Iran and the United States will meet again next week after wrapping up “constructive” nuclear talks that included the first direct contact between a Trump administration and an Iranian official, according to Iran’s state news agency.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the next round of talks will be held in Oman on April 19, adding that Saturday’s meeting “got very close” to reaching a framework for negotiations. Both sides said they are seeking an agreement in the shortest time possible, he said.

Saturday’s largely indirect talks, also held in Oman, involved US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Araghchi. The meeting took place in Omani Foreign Minister Said Badr Al Busaidi’s home in the capital Muscat, less than 10 minutes from the airport, according to a source familiar with the meeting.

During the talks, Witkoff and his team were based in a reception room to the right of the home’s grand entryway, while Araghchi and his team were in a room to the left, the source explained. The Omanis shuttled messages in English between the two sides.

After the talks ended, the two delegations spoke for just a few minutes in the marble hallway on the way out, the source said.

The meetings were held “in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect,” Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency said.

“After more than two and a half hours of indirect negotiations, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks,” the agency reported.

The White House also described the talks as “positive and constructive” and a “step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.”

Witkoff “underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations’ differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,” the White House said in a statement.

Later Saturday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that discussions are “going OK.”

“Nothing matters until you get it done,” he said while en route to a UFC fight in Miami. “So, I don’t like talking about it. But it’s going OK. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think.”

Saturday’s high-stakes talks to reach a new nuclear deal were foreshadowed by Trump’s threat of military strikes as a consequence of failure and Tehran’s warning any attack on it would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.

Iran was seeking an “initial understanding” with the US that could lead to a negotiations process, Araghchi said upon arriving in Muscat.

Al Busaidi said on X that Iran and the US will begin a process aimed at reaching a “fair and binding” agreement following the meeting.

President Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.

“I want them not to have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida on Friday night.

‘Successful first step’

CNN global affairs analyst Barak Ravid said that Saturday’s meeting represented a “very successful first step” but that the following meeting will “start dealing with the issues themselves” – including whether Trump’s two-month deadline is “enough to get a comprehensive deal.”

The talks come after the Islamic Republic has seen its regional power projection significantly weakened over the past 18 months by Israeli strikes on its proxies, the toppling of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and unprecedented attacks inside its own borders.

The stakes are high: Trump said military strikes are possible against Iran if a new nuclear deal isn’t reached, though he said Israel – which has been advocating for an attack on Iran – would take the lead.

“If it requires military, we’re going to have military,” Trump said on Wednesday. “Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. They’ll be the leader of that.”

But Iran has repeatedly refused to negotiate under duress. It laid out its “red lines” for the talks on Friday, including “threatening” language, “excessive demands” regarding Iran’s nuclear program, and Iran’s defense industry, according to semi-state news agency Tasnim, likely referring to Tehran’s ballistic missile program, which the United States’ Middle Eastern allies see as a threat to their security.

Witkoff’s participation in the talks adds another file to the array of complex and intractable issues in his expanding portfolio, and followed a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine in St Petersburg on Friday.

While the precise agenda for the next round of talks remains unclear, the president has vowed to secure a “stronger” agreement than the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration, which was meant to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, calling it a “disastrous” agreement that gave money to a regime that sponsored terrorism.

Trump wants to strike a deal that will prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon, but has not specified how it would be different to the previous agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the JCPOA. That deal was intended to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of Western sanctions that have crippled its economy.

US officials have hinted they may push Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear program, including its civilian energy component, which Tehran is entitled to under a UN nuclear treaty.

Iranian officials, however, have dismissed that proposal as a non-starter, accusing the US of using it as a pretext to weaken and ultimately topple the Islamic Republic.

Experts say Tehran sees its nuclear program as its greatest source of leverage and abandoning it would leave the country dangerously exposed.

But the administration also says it is not only looking at a possible nuclear deal: It also wants to engage Iran on a broad range of issues, a senior administration official said.

The meeting on Saturday would have tested if Iran is willing to have high-level discussions that could lead to negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and support for proxies in the region, the official said.

“Iran would be eager to jump back into something like JCPOA, so the question is: are they willing to put anything else on the table?” the official said.

Iran was ultimately motivated to engage in the talks as it faces a tough economic situation from punishing sanctions and the threat of possible military confrontation with Israel, Ali Vaez, the International Crisis Group’s Iran Project Director, told CNN.

Ahead of the meeting on Saturday, Araghchi reiterated that the talks “at this point” are “from our perspective, solely focused on the nuclear issue.”

Advisers try carrot while Trump wields stick

While Trump is threatening the prospect of war as a consequence for failed talks, other US officials have struck a far less bellicose tone.

Witkoff emphasized late last month that a diplomatic solution is within reach. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, he touted US military strength and laid out Iran’s vulnerabilities but was quick to clarify: “This is not a threat.”

“If the Iranians ever listen to this broadcast, this is not me issuing a threat. It’s the president who has that authority,” he said.

Iran’s supreme leader indicated with a recent letter to Trump an openness to talks that could lead to Iran agreeing to measures that would prevent it from building a nuclear weapon.

In a Washington Post article this week, Araghchi warned that a war on Iran would drag the US – and the region – into a costly conflict that a president, who was elected on an anti-war platform, would be eager to avoid.

“We cannot imagine President Trump wanting to become another US president mired in a catastrophic war in the Middle East – a conflict that would quickly extend across the region and cost exponentially more than the trillions of taxpayer dollars that his predecessors burned in Afghanistan and Iraq,” he wrote.

Trump administration officials have credited Israel’s actions for the position Iran finds itself in, with Witkoff saying Israel’s strikes left Iran’s defenses “eviscerated.”

But despite the united front with Israel that US administration officials have presented publicly, Trump’s announcement this week about Saturday’s talks seemed to come as a surprise to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was seated next to him. Two Israeli sources told CNN the announcement was “certainly not” to Israel’s liking.

Upon returning, Netanyahu, said that if the nuclear talks drag on, it may strike Iran anyway.

CNN previously reported that US intelligence agencies warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel appears likely to strike targets associated with Iran’s nuclear program as part of that country’s mission to enact a regime change in the Islamic Republic.

Mike Huckabee, speaking at his Senate confirmation hearing last month for the ambassadorship to Israel, stressed that he would ""carry out the president's priorities, not mine,"" suggesting that his personal views would not influence his diplomatic role.
Let's hope so. While Mr. Huckabee attempted to distance himself from his past statements on Middle East politics, those statements have reflected political and theological views that dehumanize Palestinians and ultimately dishonor the Jewish people. Nonetheless, the Senate confirmed him on Wednesday, ensuring his ideology will help shape American foreign policy in one of the most volatile regions of the world.
I am a Palestinian-American who has served as an evangelical minister for more than 20 years across the United States and the Middle East, committed to the gospel, rooted in conservative values, and walking alongside Christian believers from all backgrounds. I've seen what happens when ideology hijacks our theology. Empathy disappears, justice is dismissed, and the people who live in the land are dehumanized.
The United States has a vital role in promoting stability, justice, and peace in the Middle East. That's why I find Mike Huckabee's confirmation as U.S. ambassador to Israel so deeply troubling.
The new ambassador's vision offers no future for the millions of Palestinians, including the Christian communities of Bethlehem and elsewhere on the West Bank, in Gaza, and in East Jerusalem, who have lived in the land since the time of Jesus. I feel this personally. My own family lives in Bethlehem, and my wife's extended family remains in Gaza, where they continue to suffer under Israeli military aggression.
Over the years, Mr. Huckabee has denied the existence of the Palestinian people, calling them ""a political tool to try and force land away from Israel."" He has rejected the concepts of occupation and settlements, dismissed the legitimacy of Palestinian statehood and once declared, ""There's really no such thing as a Palestinian."" In another instance, he said, ""There is no such thing as a West Bank—it's Judea and Samaria,"" a reference to the Biblical names favored by the Israeli Right.
These are not the words of a diplomat. They reflect a disregard for international law and global consensus—including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 2334, which affirm the inadmissibility of territorial acquisition by war and declare Israeli settlements a flagrant violation of international law.
What undergirds Mr. Huckabee's statements is a strain of Christian Zionism rooted in a 19th-century end-times framework known as dispensationalism—a belief system that interprets modern events in Israel as signs of the fulfillment of Biblical prophecies.
Popularized by the 1909 Scofield Bible and modern televangelism, this theology sees Israel's 1948 founding not as Jewish self-determination but as a prophetic sign of the end times marked by global tribulation, Jewish conversion, and Christ's return to rule from Jerusalem.
On his show Huckabee Today, Mr. Huckabee enthusiastically endorsed prolific Christian author Max Lucado's end-times book, which outlines the dispensationalist timeline. Lucado, in a CBN interview, warned that ""there will be trouble on earth in the nation of Israel"" during that period. Huckabee praised Lucado's account as ""a great service"" to Christians.
This is not a fringe belief for Mr. Huckabee—it's central to how he interprets Israel's modern role. He has described the growth of Israel as ""scripture come to life,"" declared that ""God gave [Israel] to the Jewish people 3,500 years ago,"" and described the country as ""the literal fulfillment of Bible prophecy.""
These views reflect a belief that modern Israeli politics fulfill Biblical prophecy—and help explain Huckabee's disregard for Palestinian existence and suffering.
At his confirmation hearing, Mike Huckabee declared, ""We ultimately are people of the book. We believe the Bible. And therefore, that connection is not geopolitical. It is also spiritual."" That single line reveals a worldview that equates modern Israel with Biblical Israel—and views the former's politics as divinely mandated.
This approach erases divisions among Jews and Israelis and promotes government policy as the realization of prophecy. The problem isn't with the sacred text—or even its interpretation—but with how it's twisted to defend policies that contradict Christianity's core message of peace. For Palestinian Christians like my family, this politicized theology doesn't just distort the gospel—it turns it against us.
This narrative may speak the language of Christian love for Israel, but it reduces Jewish identity to a prophetic role in an end-times script. Fundamentally, it does not honor the Jewish people or affirm the richness of Judaism, no matter how often it waves the Israeli flag. Instead, it casts them—along with others—as players in a timeline that elevates theological fulfillment over human dignity and the gospel's call to love and peace.
While only a minority of Christians subscribe to this theology, it remains a powerful current in American evangelicalism.
The historian Daniel Hummel has noted that Huckabee's unwavering support for Israel is deeply rooted in his end-times understanding. As Rabbi Jonah Pesner warned in a letter to the Senate, Mr. Huckabee's ideology ""professes a love of Israel rooted in the belief that Jewish sovereignty over the biblical land of Israel will hasten the return of Jesus Christ.""
Faithful Christians hold a range of views about the end times, often shaped by sincere devotion to Scripture. But whatever one's interpretation, we cannot ignore the realities on the ground for Palestinians: decades of occupation, displacement and suffering. No end-times scenario—however sincerely held—gives us permission to turn away from injustice. That's why I joined key Middle Eastern evangelical leaders in issuing a Collective Call urging the global Church to hear the voices of Christians in the region and work toward peace.
Gaza is facing a humanitarian catastrophe: starvation, collapsing hospitals, and children undergoing surgery without painkillers. According to UNICEF, more than 15,000 children have been killed since October 7, 2023, and nearly a million have been displaced. That Mr. Huckabee has offered no word of compassion reveals the moral cost of a misguided theology fused with uncritical political loyalty—an ideology that sanctifies suffering rather than rising to the honorable role of diplomacy and the pursuit of peace.
America's strength in the Middle East lies in advancing justice, mutual respect, and lasting prosperity for all its people. We need an ambassador who walks into the room believing peace is possible—even if it's hard, even if it takes decades. We need a peacemaker, not a preacher of permanent war. Confirming Mike Huckabee sent the opposite message: that U.S. diplomacy is no longer anchored in truth or compassion, but in ideology masquerading as faith. An ambassador's role is to build bridges—not to hasten the apocalypse.

Good morning,
Michael Marcagi - Scared to Start: I've been jamming out to this song all week. Apparently it was huge on TikTok like a year ago, but now that I'm 40 I am no longer expected to know/care about anything happening on social media. It's quite liberating, actually, I highly recommend. Anyway, this dude's got a great voice. Good weekend listening.
Speaking of TikTok, I have a proposal for the White House. Mr. President, if you are listening, and you are serious about staking your legacy on winning a new cold war with China, you must ban TikTok. It flew under the radar over the last week or so, but the Biden deadline and then Trump-imposed extension for China to divest itself from TikTok—or else the app would go dark in the U.S.—came and went without much of a peep. It was widely reported that the White House was in the final stages of a deal with TikTok-parent ByteDance to spin the app out under new US ownership, but then it all went to hell in a handbasket with the tariffs.
It seems unlikely Beijing has any incentive to do a deal now, which puts Trump in the position of either just ignoring his own deadline (and the law, as though that matters at this point) or actually ripping off the Band-Aid and putting this Chinese spy and propaganda app out of its misery in the U.S. I get it, there's like 100 million Americans using TikTok, he doesn't want to piss them off, especially the younger voters who have warmed to him. But if we are serious about isolating China, how can you let a social media service owned and operated by the CCP to be installed on every phone in America? Shut it down, Mr. President. The kids will be alright (in fact, they'll probably thank you, in the same way an addict thanks his family for intervening once he's clean and sober). And if you need air cover, just ask one of these sycophantic tech bros to build their own version. Isn't Instagram just a TikTok clone at this point anyway? If we're going to poison the minds of the next generation of Americans, can we at least require that it be an American company that does the poisoning?
Bit of a digression there, but I'm serious. Trump cannot allow the most popular social/propaganda app to remain owned by the Chinese while he's trying to carry out this huge global reordering against China. On the ongoing trade war, I think we will look back on these last couple days as the week when reality set in. That brief relief rally in the market lasted exactly one afternoon. The Trump trade—investing in American business—has given way to the 'Sell America' trade. U.S. stocks, Treasurys and now the dollar are all plunging. It seems very bad that the market is no longer viewing U.S. bonds or the Almighty Dollar as safe haven assets. There's a theory that Trump wants the USD to be weaker to make our exports more attractive, but this seems like the administration is trying to have its cake and eat it too. Do you want to make American exports attractive to the rest of the world? Or do you want to intentionally harm the purchasing power of the rest of the world? You can't do both.
One last thing before we head into the weekend. I've heard this from several of you, as well as a good friend of mine with whom I got into a heated tariff-related (and cocktail-lubricated) argument the other night. That by focusing so much on how this is all impacting the stock market, it is somehow elitist. Put aside what these same people would say if any Democrat intentionally crashed the market, that is simply false. More than 60% of Americans are exposed to stocks or mutual funds through IRAs, 401(k)s, pensions, etc. It is not true that the market is only reflecting hedge funders or other over-levered Wall Street types losing their shirts. The fact that the S&P is down 15% since Trump came in and not 25% is not the winning political argument you guys think it is.
""If the United States will not fight the world's largest tyranny politically, then inevitably, it will have to fight it economically, and eventually, militarily,"" Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng told the U.S. Congress in 2000. What has emerged as a trade war by President Donald Trump with Xi Jinping's China underlines the much larger struggle for global dominance between the rival powers and the very real possibility of the military conflict for which both sides are now gearing up intensively.

Colorado, Im r… [+2279 chars]","CNN —

Democratic Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet announced Friday that he is running for governor in 2026 as the one-time presidential candidate looks to succeed term-limited Gov. Jared Polis.

“Colorado, I’m running for Governor. From expanding the Child Tax Credit to securing $7B for Colorado’s infrastructure, we’ve made real progress together. Now, it’s time to keep building a future in Colorado that works for all of us,” Bennet wrote on social media with an accompanying video.

In the video, Bennet touts his Colorado roots and his record in the Senate, pointing to work on the child tax credit, prescription drug costs, and public land preservation. And Bennet also offered sharp criticism of President Donald Trump, reflecting the escalating tone of his party’s opposition.

“Donald Trump doesn’t believe in building opportunity. He believes in taking a wrecking ball to our economy and our democracy,” Bennet says in the video. And he referenced his dissatisfaction with battles in Congress, saying that “our best solutions to these challenges will not come from the broken politics practiced in Washington.”

Bennet has represented Colorado in the Senate since 2009, mounting a short-lived bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination as one of the more moderate candidates in a crowded field. He won his last election in 2022 by 14 points, and enters the Democratic gubernatorial primary in a strong position in the reliably blue state that hasn’t elected a Republican governor in more than two decades.

The move by Bennet makes him the fourth Senate Democrat to announce plans to depart Congress after next year, following announcements by Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who have all said this year they will not seek reelection in 2026. Bennet isn’t up for reelection in the Senate until 2028, allowing him to pursue the governor’s office while still serving in Washington.

The veteran lawmaker has been endorsed by several other prominent Colorado Democrats, including his colleague Sen. John Hickenlooper and US Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow. He’ll face some competition in the primary, however, as Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser launched a gubernatorial bid earlier this year.

And on the Republican side, a few state lawmakers have announced campaigns, though the Colorado GOP’s bench is thinner than Democrats’ in the state, which has a “solid Democrat” rating for its governor race from Inside Elections.",Left

After the vice president’s visit, Col. Susannah Meyers emailed base personnel on March 31, writing, ""I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.""
She added that she had ""spent the weekend thinking about Friday's visit — the actions taken, the words spoken, and how it must have affected each of you."" The email was first reported by Military.com.

Tiffany Trump is pregnant, as her father Donald Trump revealed at a campaign event in October. On Sunday, April 6, Tiffany’s half-sister, Ivanka Trump, threw her a Peter Rabbit–themed baby shower in Miami, which was sweet of her:

Less sweet: Tiffany’s stepmother, Melania Trump, did not attend the shower.

And downright savage: the reason “a Florida source” gave People for the First Lady’s absence:

However, PEOPLE confirms that neither Tiffany’s father nor her stepmother, first lady Melania Trump, were present at the celebration — a detail that the source says isn’t “surprising.”

The Florida source said they didn’t think there was “any reason” for Melania to attend Tiffany’s shower, noting that the first lady — who began dating Donald when Tiffany was about 5 — “has her own schedule, even on weekends.”

PEOPLE is told that Melania was busy with her son, Barron, 19, over the weekend.

Now, obviously, Melania herself did not say she didn’t see “any reason” to attend the shower, and it’s possible the source is wrong. But just the fact that Melania wasn’t there is really something. The event was attended by all the other women in the president’s extended family, including Tiffany’s mother, Marla Maples; her sister-in-law Lara Trump; and even Don Jr.’s new girlfriend, Bettina Anderson:

Kari Lake and Don Jr.’s ex Kimberly Guilfoyle sent well wishes in the comments on Tiffany’s Instagram post:

But Melania didn’t even leave a “So sorry I couldn’t be there!” comment. Apparently, even a low-effort display of affection for her stepdaughter of 20 years would clash too much with the First Lady’s carefully cultivated “I really don’t care do U?” vibe.",Left

Some grassroots organizers are floating the idea of a female-led sex strike following the House's passage of the SAVE Act.
The Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act passed the House of Representatives Thursday, despite critics saying it will make it harder for married women, rural people, troops overseas, racial minorities, and disabled people to register to vote.
In response, some organizers online are posting about the idea of having a sex strike to draw attention to the SAVE Act.
The SAVE Act requires people to produce an ID and a birth certificate or passport as documentary proof of citizenship in order to register to vote. This has raised alarms for married women whose last name on their ID does not match their last name on their birth certificate.
The SAVE Act still has to pass the Senate before becoming law, and some organizers may use actions such as a sex strike to show how unpopular the act is. However, the organizers online do not appear to be clear at the moment in their goals or vision for their proposed sex strike.
This is not the first sex blackout suggested by American women due to Republican politics. Following the 2024 Election, the 4B Movement—a boycott on relationships with men—was floated as an idea to oppose conservative patriarchal notions and male Trump voters in the US.
Although the 4B Movement has gained some popular ground in South Korea, it has not received much attention in the U.S. since November 2024, and is unclear whether anybody has actively embraced the 4B Movement.
A sex strike around the SAVE Act was floated on Reddit by members of 50501, a group that organizes protests against the Trump administration.
The organizers have been contacted via Reddit and 50501 has been contacted via email for comment.
The idea of the sex strike appears to be more of a technique to divert attention toward the SAVE Act, rather than a plan for an actual strike.
Under posts titled ""Sex Strike for SAVE Act"" and ""Sex Strike to bring light to SAVE Act"" organizers wrote about how the SAVE Act will impact women voters, and asked: ""Are there any women here who are involved in organizing for women-specific orgs? I'd like to get together and brainstorm.""
These posts do not contain any details on how a sex strike would actually work, or how long it would hypothetically go on for.
Not all people are on board. Some commenters under these posts are critical of the idea of a sex strike saying ""I feel like if your partner isn't aware or proactively angry about the SAVE Act upon hearing about it... you should maybe just dump that partner?""
Another commenter said: ""A sex strike is a stupid idea. For one thing, people can be forced to have sex, and for another, unless you're having sex with a member of Congress, what impact whatsoever would it have? None. A campaign to encourage women to change their names and/or get their passport/RealID would be far more effective. That's something women can actually DO.""
Although a sex strike may be hard to carry out, a women's labor strike could be a more impactful and effective way to protest the SAVE Act.
In 1975, a women's labor strike in Iceland resulted in the Icelandic parliament passing a gender equality bill enshrining wage equality and anti-workplace discrimination laws.
The strike was carried out by 90 percent of Icelandic women, who effectively shut down schools, airlines, telecommunications companies, and newspapers in the country by refusing to show up to work. They also did not cook meals for their families to show how much labor they did at home as well.
Proponents of the SAVE Act say it will prevent noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and have said many other countries have voter ID laws.
Detractors have said that multiple audits in recent years have found that noncitizens have zero impact on federal elections and that voter ID laws in other countries, such as the U.K. and Canada have protocols in place that enable married women who have changed their last name to vote easily.
Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, said: ""The House has just passed one of the worst pieces of voting legislation in American history. The Senate must stop it. The SAVE Act would put voting out of reach for millions of American citizens. It should not become law.""
Andrea Hailey, the CEO of Vote.org, said in a statement sent to Newsweek: ""I am appalled by the House's decision to pass this bill. The SAVE Act is a blatant attempt at voter suppression, disguised as an ""election integrity"" measure. It seeks to impose ballot box barriers for low-income Americans, women, seniors, rural voters, and communities of color, by requiring strict ID documentation that millions lack, and eliminating online voter registration entirely.""
Senator Alex Padilla in a statement sent to Newsweek: ""Voting by noncitizens is already a federal crime, and it is extremely rare. This is just another attempt by Donald Trump and extreme Republicans to scapegoat immigrants for their loss in the 2020 election. Let me be clear: this is not about immigrants or immigration. This is about the voting rights of American citizens.
""I am leading the fight in the Senate to push back against this effort to disrupt our already safe and secure elections. This bill cannot pass the Senate—and I will fight every step of the way to block it.""
The SAVE Act has passed the House of Representatives, but still has to pass the Senate. It needs 60 votes to pass, and Republicans currently have a majority with 53 seats.
Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called the bill ""noxious"" and said, ""Let me be clear, under my Leadership Senate Democrats will make sure this power grab does not pass the Senate.""",Center

The ones that include a range of information about the senders — phone numbers, addresses, social media handles. And in recent years, pronouns — letting the recipient know that the sender goes by “she,” “he,” “they” or something else, a digital acknowledgement that people claim a range of gender identities.

Among those who don’t agree with that are President Donald Trump and members of his administration. They have taken aim at what he calls “gender ideology” with measures like an executive order requiring the United States to recognize only two biological sexes, male and female. Federal employees were told to take any references to their pronouns out of their email signatures.

That stance seems to have spread beyond those who work for the government to those covering it. According to some journalists’ accounts, officials in the administration have refused to engage with reporters who have pronouns listed in their signatures.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that two of its journalists and one at another outlet had received responses from administration officials to email queries that declined to engage with them over the presence of the pronouns. In one case, a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory received an email reply from Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, saying, “As a matter of policy, we do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.”

It was unclear if this has become a formal policy of the administration. Leavitt did not respond to a request for comment.

In a statement to other news outlets, Leavitt said that “Any reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story.”

Email signatures as a point of contention

In its statement, The Times said, “Evading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting. But refusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration’s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.”

That even the words in email signatures could become yet another point of ideological contention is actually not surprising. Language — the words we use, the words we don’t, what we think we can and can’t say to others and they to us — represents a kind of “social signaling,” says Lauren Hall-Lew, professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

“The extent to which conversations around language and language policing are stronger and more politically bifurcated now would only be a reflection of the actual politics on the ground,” Hall-Lew says. “That’s what all of language is — it’s to communicate. But because we’re communicating between people, because people are messy, then all language becomes political.”

Pronoun identifiers in email signatures are no exception, she says. There was “a time when if you had pronouns in your sig files, assume that you were transgender. And we have come a long way in the sense that that is no longer the assumption for a lot of people. It’s more to do with your political positionality relative to transgender issues. And that was kind of the goal, actually, in trying to get cisgender people to put their pronouns in.”

The Associated Press has been involved in its own dispute with White House officials that includes issues of language. It sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds over being excluded from White House events after the news agency had decided not to follow Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico.

Vance visited Pituffik Space Base along with second lady Usha Vance in late March, where he criticized Denmark's leadership of the semi-autonomous island, claiming the NATO country has ""not done a good job by the people of Greenland"" and ""underinvested in the security architecture."" Vance suggested Greenlanders could seek independence from Denmark and ""we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there."" He said he did not believe military force would be needed to take over the island, echoing Mr. Trump's statements.

The base is now overseen by Col. Shawn Lee, according to the spokesperson.

Located in the northwestern part of Greenland, Pituffik Space Base is the U.S. military's northernmost installation, dating back to the Cold War.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, citing national security concerns, despite pushback from political leaders in both Greenland and Denmark. Some 85% of Greenlanders do not want to join the United States, according to a recent poll.

DENVER -- U.S. Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is running for Colorado governor next year, saying in an interview with The Associated Press that he could better oppose President Donald Trump from the governor's office.

Bennet, whose practical approach to Democratic politics has been punctuated more recently by fiery and viral moments, has spent over 16 years in the U.S. Senate. Now, he joins a growing field of candidates from both parties vying for Colorado’s executive seat.

Colorado's recent transition to a solidly Democratic state gives Democrats a strong advantage, and Bennet's stiffest competition will likely come from Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser.

Weiser was already on the attack Thursday, insinuating in a statement that Bennet shouldn't leave his Senate seat at a time of such political upheaval in the nation's capital.

Bennet's position in Congress has given him a political pulpit in Washington, D.C., as when he questioned Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during the Secretary of Health and Human Services' confirmation hearings. But in an interview with the AP, Bennet said his decision to join the governor's race isn't a retreat from political battles.

“There is not a person in the Senate who’s more worried about what Trump is doing to our democracy and our economy than I am,"" Bennet said. “I have come to believe strongly that the best place to fight that fight is from the state of Colorado.”

Bennet is currently pressing to make permanent expansion of the child tax credit, and in the past has advocated for bipartisan legislation to address immigration and border security. A central part of his campaign is tackling the affordable housing crisis.

In his 16th year in the Senate, Bennet has been frustrated with Congress' seeming inability to act decisively. He is the latest in a line of Democrats leaving Congress to seek governor's offices.

As Congress struggled last year to agree on wartime aid for Ukraine, the senator tried nearly everything possible to prod his colleagues forward: legislative maneuvers, bipartisan agreements and sharing personal stories to move the needle, as when he recounted how his mother had fled Poland during the Holocaust.

Bennet has long sought a prominent position in the Democratic Party, including unsuccessfully running in the presidential primary in 2020. Last year, he was among the first Senate Democrats to openly call for then-President Joe Biden to withdraw from the election, and amid recent criticism of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, suggested the party will be looking for new leaders.

“The Democratic Party has to figure out what it is we’re going to offer going forward,” Bennet said. “What we have to offer is a vision not into the past, but into the future, about how we are going to create an economy again in America that, when it grows, it grows for everybody.”

A former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, Bennet plans to focus his campaign not simply on opposing Trump, but on the cost of housing and health care and putting Colorado in a position to lead other states. He said he wants to make it “easier and faster to build housing” by removing red tape.

At a campaign launch event at Denver's City Park Friday morning, Bennet plans to announce endorsements from a number of Colorado Democrats.

The winning gubernatorial candidate will replace term-limited Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat whose name has been bandied about as a presidential contender, though the governor has demurred from questions about his political future.

Bennet represents a similar wing of the Democratic Party to Polis — fiscally moderate and socially liberal — without the current governor’s quirkiness.

Polis revels in nerd culture, quoting Yoda in speeches to the Legislature, and is more inclined to buck party orthodox than Bennet, a child of a prominent diplomat with a professorial demeanor who delights in asking people what books they’re reading.

A Bennet victory, however, could open up a Senate seat to a new generation. The state’s younger Democratic representatives in the U.S. House, such as Joe Neguse, Brittany Pettersen or Jason Crow, may seek the position in the future.

The Senate's Democratic Caucus is already anticipating a generational change. Three other Democrats — Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan and Tina Smith of Minnesota — have already announced they will not seek reelection in 2026.

The Republican candidates in Colorado's gubernatorial race include two state lawmakers, Sen. Mark Baisley and Rep. Scott Bottoms. They face an uphill battle with the states' political shifts as GOP contenders have failed to secure statewide offices in recent elections.

The tourist helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon appears to have fallen victim to a well-known hazard known as “mast bumping,” according to aviation experts. Eyewitness video showed the rotors and the body of the helicopter separating in midair. The phenomenon is unique to helicopters with semi-rigid rotors, like the Bell 206L4 LongRanger that fell out of the sky while flying a family of Spanish tourists. The pilot, two adult passengers, and three children were all killed.

The phenomenon of mast bumping arises from the physics of the rotor blades. Each helicopter blade is like a long, thin wing that generates lift as it carves through the air. Spinning at high speed, the blades form a whirring disk. The blades are attached to a hub that in turn is connected to a mast that projects vertically upward from the transmission. To visualize the relationship of the mast and the rotor hub, says Robert Joslin, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, in Daytona, Florida, “Think of a drinking cup upside down on the top of a broom handle. If you just move it back and forth a little bit, it won’t touch. But if you go real hard, the rim will hit the handle.” In the case of the helicopter, the hub is a fast-spinning hunk of metal that could bend the mast or break it altogether, severing the rotor and sending it flying.

There’s another potential problem with moving the controls too vigorously. The helicopter blades are flexible, like a pool noodle. If you lower them quickly, their momentum will keep their tips moving in the same direction after the base of the blade has stopped. If the rear of the disk is moving downwards, says aviation attorney Jim Brauchle, “the rotor comes down and actually hits the body of the helicopter. And what we can see from the video that it looks like that’s exactly what happened, because the complete tail section is gone.”

Losing both tail and rotor at the same time will cause the fuselage to plummet, tumbling as it goes, while the tail falls separately and the rotor goes spinning off like a boomerang. The danger is so well-known for this kind of helicopter that the FAA includes a section explaining the risk in its Helicopter Flying Handbook.

The helicopter involved in Thursday’s accident was owned by a Louisiana company, Meridian Helicopters, and operated by New York Helicopter Charter of Kearny, New Jersey. According to flight data, the helicopter had picked up Siemens executive Augustín Escobar, his wife, and three children at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m., then flew north along the Manhattan shore of the Hudson up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back and flying along the New Jersey side of the river. It was descending in preparation for landing at the heliport at the time of the accident.

It’s conceivable that a mechanical failure could have caused a breakage in the assembly that connects the rotor to the fuselage, allowing it to detach and fly free. This happened in 2016 to an Airbus helicopter that was ferrying workers to an oil platform in the North Sea. Video taken at the time shows the triple-bladed rotor spinning through the air.

However, that wouldn’t explain why the tail of the helicopter was chopped off.

At the time of the accident winds were strong and gusty, blowing at 20 mph from the south-southeast with gusts of up to 25 mph. While these kinds of wind speeds are not dangerous in themselves, wind moving over tall buildings — in this case, high-rises of lower Manhattan — can cause dramatic turbulence in much the same way that rocks in a stream can cause roiling currents downstream. “Turbulence is usually the main culprit in mast bumping,” Brauchle says.

The phenomenon can also occur as a result of certain maneuvers that are dangerous in semi-rigid rotor helicopters, such as when a pilot pushes the helicopter nose downward in a so-called “pushover.” This puts the aircraft in a low-g condition and creates the sensation of loss of control that can induce pilots to make fatally abrupt movements. An inexperienced helicopter pilot might do a pushover while arcing over a hilltop or while diving to avoid an oncoming aircraft.

Accidents involving tourist helicopters are not uncommon in the Manhattan airspace. It’s busy and involves a mix of fixed-wing and rotor aircraft that have to avoid one another without help from a control tower. Brauchle represented the family members of passengers aboard a sightseeing helicopter that collided with a light airplane near the Statue of Liberty in 2009. In 2018, a sightseeing helicopter flying with its doors off crashed near Roosevelt Island, killing all five passengers.

We may never know exactly what triggered the mast bumping that felled the Bell LongRanger 206 on Thursday. Helicopters of that size typically don’t carry black boxes that can help air-accident investigators and there are no survivors to clarify what was going on at the moment of upset. “Maybe he saw a flock of birds or something and tried to maneuver to avoid it or something,” Brauchle says. “I don’t know.”",Left
CNN,Shania Shelton,US removes commander in Greenland following Vance’s controversial visit | CNN Politics,"The US announced it removed the commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on Thursday because of a “loss of confidence in her ability to lead,” after Vice President JD Vance’s controversial visit to the semiautonomous island last month.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/politics/us-removes-greenland-commander/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2206765991.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2025-04-11T11:30:12Z,"The US announced it removed the commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on Thursday because of a loss of confidence in her ability to lead, after Vice President JD Vances controversial visi… [+2166 chars]","CNN —

The US announced it removed the commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on Thursday because of a “loss of confidence in her ability to lead,” after Vice President JD Vance’s controversial visit to the semiautonomous island last month.

“Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense,” Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell wrote in a statement posted to X on Thursday announcing the removal of Susannah Meyers.

Following Vance’s visit to the island in late March, Military.com reported that Meyers sent out an email to the space base pushing back on the vice president’s actions and comments during the trip. Parnell included a link to the Military.com story in his X post.

The news site reported the ousted commander wrote in an email, “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.”

Colonel Shawn Lee took over Meyers’ position, according to a press release from the Space Operations Command.

The removal highlights continued moves for United States control over Greenland as President Donald Trump has vowed to acquire the land “one way or another,” and Vance has repeatedly claimed the island is vulnerable and that the US had “no other option” than to ramp up its presence there.

Vance, alongside his wife, second lady Usha Vance, visited the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk last month. Usha Vance was originally planning to attend a dogsled race on the island, but expected protests and silent demonstrations altered her visit.

During his trip, the vice president made a high-profile case for American control of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. He said Greenland would be better off “coming under the United States’ security umbrella than you have been under Denmark’s security umbrella.”

Trump has also been vocal about his goal to acquire Greenland and has said he “won’t take anything off the table” to obtain the island, including military force, but that there is a “good possibility” it won’t be needed. He also has confirmed he has “absolutely” engaged in serious discussions about the potential annexation of Greenland.",Left

Supreme Court says Trump admin must ‘facilitate’ release of mistakenly deported man

The Supreme Court said the Trump administration is required to ""facilitate"" the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison, days after justices said the Trump administration didn't need to meet a Monday night deadline to return him to the U.S.

Yesterday's decision partly grants and partly rejects the Justice Department's emergency request contending to a district court judge's order that Abrego Garcia be retrieved from a prison where he was sent along with other men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang. That means the Trump administration does not immediately have to try to return Abrego Garcia because a deadline imposed by the judge had already expired. But the administration ""should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.""

The decision could give a boost to Venezuelans who were deported without due process before courts intervened.

Immigration officials allege Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally, is a member of the MS-13 gang but have conceded that he should not have been sent to El Salvador, calling it an “administrative error.” In 2019, an immigration judge ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because there was “a clear probability of future persecution.”

Spanish couple named as victims in fatal New York helicopter crash

New York authorities have named two of the six victims who died when a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson on Thursday afternoon as Agustín Escobar and Merce Camprubi Montal, a married couple from Spain.

A spokesperson for City Hall said overnight that the couple were among the three adults and three children to have died in the accident. The names of the other victims have not yet been formally released.

The three children were believed to be the couple’s children and the third adult victim was the pilot.

Escobar was a senior executive with the German technology firm Siemens and was the CEO of rail infrastructure at its Siemens Mobility Division. Previously he was the CEO and president of Siemens Spain, according to a company announcement.

Calls to 911 operators rushed in at 3:17 p.m on Thursday as the sightseeing helicopter lost control shortly after it turned at the George Washington Bridge to move along the New Jersey shoreline.

Video showed the body of the helicopter plunging into the water, apparently having lost its propeller. Witnesses said they heard a loud sound, which one person described as possible engine failure, before they saw the helicopter go down. Here’s what else we know.

Ballerina imprisoned by Russia returns to the U.S.

Ksenia Karelina, a former ballerina who had been living in Los Angeles before she was arrested in Russia over a $51.80 charity donation, returned to the United States late Thursday after a prisoner exchange. Karelina was arrested in February 2024 and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony for “high treason” over allegations that she financially supported Ukraine’s military. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she had been wrongfully detained.

Karelina was seen smiling as she exited the plane, which touched down last night at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, D.C., and she was embraced by people waiting for her outside the jet. Read more about the prisoner swap that allowed for her return.

The Maine high school at the center of Trump’s war on trans student athletes

Greely High School in Cumberland, Maine. Sofia Aldinio for NBC News

When a state politician in Maine in February took to social media to complain about a transgender girl winning a pole vaulting event at a high school track meet, President Donald Trump and his administration took notice.

Now, Greely High School is at the center of a conflict over Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The Trump administration has threatened to pull over $200 million in annual funding for Maine if the state does not comply by today with an executive order that effectively banned transgender students from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.

Outsiders see the showdown as an important test of how far the administration will go to force states to follow executive orders. Meanwhile, students and families at Greely, located in the suburbs of Portland, are anxiously awaiting their fate.

“We’re getting what feels like hatred from high-ranking people in the government, and it’s coming down on kids who don’t really have much power or say,” said a sophomore on the track team who supports transgender students’ right to compete. Read the full story here.

So she was devastated to learn in February that the National Park Service drastically altered a webpage on Tubman and the Underground Railroad, watering down language around slavery and racism in America. “It tore me apart,” Daniels said exclusively to reporter Curtis Bunn.

The NPS has restored the original wording after public outrage, but the webpage was just one of thousands on federal websites that have either been removed or changed to cut anything that may be considered DEI. “My question is: Why do they want to erase our Black history?” Daniels asked. “Why are we such a threat to certain Americans?” — Michelle Garcia, NBC BLK editorial director

What are you supposed to do, exactly, when the president won’t stop Tasering the economy for fun? As far as the markets go, if you don’t trade stocks or import goods for a living, the conventional wisdom is the same, just delivered in a quieter voice with sweatier pits: Don’t do anything stupid, uh, wait it out, think long term. You could sit and scroll and worry about your job or your retirement or the future more broadly. You could resolve to become more or less politically engaged. Or you could rephrase all this uncertainty and fear in the form of the most American question of all: What should I buy?

Answers are all over the place. Some people are reportedly panic-buying cars, appliances, TVs, and other big-ticket items or at least moving their purchase timelines forward. Others are thinking smaller, reading up on sourcing, and buying with more precision, stocking up on cat food, sunscreen, and hair extensions. Some Asian grocery stores are reportedly busier than usual. People are stocking up on wine and worrying about medicine. But there’s one product about which regular people and Wall Street analysts are unusually and similarly concerned: the iPhone. Mark Gurman surveyed some Apple stores, which employees described as currently comparable to a “busy holiday season”:

Employees from different Apple locations across the country said stores filled with customers over the weekend — with the shoppers expressing concerns that prices will climb dramatically after the levies are imposed. Most iPhones, Apple’s best-selling and most important product, are manufactured in China, which is in line for tariffs of 54 percent. One employee said their store was slammed with people panic-buying phones: “Almost every customer asked me if prices were going to go up soon,” said the worker, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

As panic-buys go, iPhones — and other Apple products — are emblematic. They’re expensive but hugely popular. Their supply chains are long and complicated but the subject of lots of coverage. Everyone knows Apple became one of America’s strongest companies with the help of Chinese manufacturing, and even if you’re up-to-date on the company’s recent moves to diversify into India, Vietnam, and elsewhere, you know Apple is extremely exposed to tariffs. Smartphones have become a necessity, and people have developed strong expectations around price. They’re worried tariffs could send the cost of iPhones way, way up, and the president is calling out Apple specifically.

Analysts agree: UBS estimated a 30 percent price increase for iPhones manufactured in China, pushing the price of an $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max to around $1,500, and that was when the proposed tariff rates were “just” 54 percent, versus the 145 percent Trump now says the rate is. Analysts told The Wall Street Journal that the cost of manufacturing an $1,100 iPhone under the 54 percent regime would increase from $580 to $850. Reuters tallied some plausible costs and came up with similarly eye-popping numbers: a $799 model going to $1,142; a $1,599 model to $2,300, and the budget-oriented 16e from $599 to $856.

Lutnick: ""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones -- that kind of thing is going to come to America."" pic.twitter.com/g9TqxGxLHs — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 6, 2025

If, as the administration says, the intention is to move iPhone manufacturing to the United States, these numbers go much, much higher. Wedbush’s Dan Ives outlined a made-in-the-USA iPhone scenario in which a $1,000 phone goes to $3,500.

This is a big round number based on a lot of assumptions that aren’t likely to come true together, but the prospect of a $3,500 iPhone is a useful absurdity. It would be the most expensive smartphone in the world. It would, for the first few years of this theoretical capability build-out, be a shoddier product than its counterparts built elsewhere. It’s a thing that, under the conditions that would produce it, simply would not be produced. The world of the $3,500 iPhone is less like mid-century America than early-COVID America: a place where certain types of things aren’t just out of reach but nearly impossible to obtain.

The $3,500 iPhone is best understood as a symbol of the state of mutually assured destruction between Donald Trump and the broader economy. On one side, the president is threatening tariffs so high they’re indistinguishable from embargos; on the other, the market is saying, well, if you really do that, things well and truly fall apart. The government has immense leverage over Apple and Tim Cook, who negotiated a tariff exemption in Trump’s previous term in exchange for promises to invest more in the U.S. (this time, the arrangement appears to be a bit closer to personal bribery). But Apple has some leverage too, alongside other large companies that help keep the market indexes afloat. Place high and sudden enough tariffs on China — and India and Vietnam, where Apple also manufactures iPhones — and the physical avatar of American capitalism simply ceases to exist.

President Donald Trump remains adamant that his administration will engage in ""direct"" nuclear talks with Iran on Saturday in Oman, while Tehran appears to remain equally steadfast in its insistence the negotiations will be ""indirect.""
Middle East envoy Stever Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Oman, where he could potentially be meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, though the Iranian official has so far maintained the talks will be held through a third party.
While it remains unclear who will get their way regarding the format of the discussions, Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Behnam Ben Taleblu, said this public controversy between Washington and Tehran is all a game of leverage.
""Both sides have an incentive to either overrepresent or underrepresent what is happening,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""These are often the negotiations before the negotiations."" 
IRAN MULLS PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON US BASE AFTER TRUMP BOMB THREATS

""For the White House, the desire to be seen as having direct talks with the Islamic Republic is high,"" he said, pointing to the lack of direct engagement between Washington and Tehran dating back to his first term and the regime’s deep disdain for the president, as witnessed in an apparent assassination attempt. 
While the Iranian government has long held contempt for the U.S., a sentiment that has persisted for decades, Trump is ""very different,"" Ben Taleblu said.
The security expert highlighted the 2020 assassination of top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the crippling effect of the U.S.-sanctioned maximum-pressure campaign and Trump’s open support for the Iranian people as the major issues that have rankled the Iranian regime.
""Trump is a very bitter pill to swallow, and I think the supreme leader of Iran once said that the shoe of Qasem Soleimani has more honor than the head of Trump,"" Ben Taleblu said. ""Being seen as directly negotiating with someone [like that] would be making the Islamic Republic look like a supplicant. 
""The U.S. wants to be seen as having driven Iran to the negotiating table, and the Islamic Republic does not want to be seen as being driven to the negotiating table,"" he added.

AHEAD OF TRUMP ADMIN-IRAN TALKS, NEW REPORT SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT RISES TO 'EXTREME DANGER'
Tehran’s chief advantage is the fact that, despite severe U.S. sanctions and geopolitical attempts to halt its development of a nuclear weapon, it has made serious gains in its enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade quality, as well as with its missile program, a critical component in being able to actually fire a nuclear warhead.
It also has drastically closer ties with chief U.S. adversarial superpowers like Russia and China, whose position and involvement in countering Western attempts to disarm a nuclear Iran remains an unknown at this point. 
While Iran holds significant leverage when it comes to negotiating with the Trump administration on its nuclear program, Washington has a plethora of levers it can use to either incentivize or coerce Tehran into adhering to international calls for the end of its nuclear program.
""The U.S. actually has a heck of a lot of leverage here,"" Ben Taleblu said, pointing to not only more economic sanctions, including ""snapback"" mechanisms under the United Nations Security Council, but also military options.
Trump last month threatened to ""bomb"" Iran if it did not engage in nuclear talks with the U.S.
But some have questioned how long the administration will allow negotiations to persist as JCPOA-era snapback sanctions expire in October 2025.
The White House would not confirm for Fox News Digital any time restrictions it has issued to Iran, but Trump on Wednesday told reporters, ""We have a little time, but we don’t have much time.""

TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOP IRAN FROM MAKING NUCLEAR BOMB: 'DANGEROUS TERRITORY'
""The regime has its back against the wall,"" Ben Taleblu said. ""A military option, given what has been happening in the Middle East since Oct. 7, 2023, is an increasingly credible option against the Islamic Republic of Iran.""
""And the regime is engaging, now, to delay and prevent a military option from ever materializing,"" he added. ""They are hoping to use talks with the Americans as a human shield against the Israelis.""
""So long as you're talking to America, the Israelis aren't shooting at you,"" Ben Taleblu continued. 
Trump this week said that it would be Israel who would take the lead on a military strike on Iran, not the U.S., should nuclear talks fail, which again could be a negotiating tactic as Israel has already demonstrated it will not hesitate to militarily engage with Iran.
""Pursuing wholesale disarmament of the Islamic Republic of Iran is incredibly risky, and it doesn't have a great track record of succeeding,"" Ben Taleblu said.

The Iranian expert said the only way to actually take on the Islamic Republic would be through a ""broader"" and ""more holistic"" strategy that focuses not only on nuclear nonproliferation but removing the ""Axis of Resistance,"" scaling up sanctions and having a ""ground game"" to counter the regime through cyber, political and telecommunication strategies ""for when Iranians go out into the street and protest again.""
""What the Islamic Republic would always want is to have you focus on the fire and not on the arsonist, and the arsonist is quite literally a regime that has tried to kill this president,"" Ben Taleblu said.

Donald Trump’s presidential payback tour rages on, and now it’s personal. It’s one thing to target multibillion-dollar law firms, universities, and media outlets for organizational retribution; those efforts, aimed at stifling and punishing any criticism or dissent, are reprehensible in their own right. But now Trump is going after individual private citizens, using the might of the executive branch to potentially throw his detractors in prison.

In a pair of official proclamations — rendered no less unhinged by the use of official fonts and White House letterhead — Trump identifies two targets who worked in the federal government during his first tenure and dared to speak out publicly against him. First: Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency from 2018 to 2020 and made headlines when he publicly contradicted Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. For this act of heretical truth-telling, Trump labels Krebs “a significant bad-faith actor” — whatever the hell that means — who poses grave “risks” to the American public.

And then there’s Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who publicly criticized the president in an anonymous book and various media appearances. Taylor, like Krebs, purportedly poses “risks” to the United States, is a “bad-faith actor” (though apparently not a significant one like Krebs), and “stoked dissension” with his public commentary.

Are you scared? Don’t you fear the “risks” posed by these two monsters?

True to the form he has displayed when going after disfavored law firms, Trump hits below the belt. The president ordered security clearances stripped not only from Krebs and Taylor but also from everyone who works with them (Krebs at a private cybersecurity firm, Taylor at the University of Pennsylvania). He’s punishing his targets — plus their employers and colleagues, First Amendment freedom of association be darned.

It gets worse. In a separate set of orders, Trump directed the attorney general to open criminal investigations of Krebs and Taylor. Notably absent from the orders is any plausible notion that either might have committed a federal crime. This hardly needs to be said, but it’s not a federal crime to be a “bad-faith actor,” to “stoke dissension,” or even to be a “wise guy,” as Trump called Krebs from the Oval Office.

The next move is Pam Bondi’s — and we know how this will go.

Any reasonable, ethical attorney general would follow the bedrock principle that a prosecutor must have “predication” — some kernel of fact on which to believe a crime might have been committed — to open a criminal investigation. The bar is low, but it serves the vital purpose of preventing precisely the baseless retributive inquests that Trump has now ordered up. In observance of this foundational precept, even Bill Barr — the subject of sharp criticism in my first book, Hatchet Man — generally ignored Trump’s public pleas for the arrests of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and others. Like the exhausted parent of an unruly toddler, Barr would mostly sit back and let the tantrum pass.

Don’t count on Bondi taking the same course of passive resistance to the president. She has already shown her true colors, and they’re whatever shade Trump pleases. For example, despite the distinct possibility of criminality by top administration officials around the Signal scandal, the AG refused even to investigate. Instead, she decreed — after zero inquiry, with zero evidence — that information about military attack plans was somehow not classified, and that nobody had acted recklessly. Case closed; no inquiry needed.

Bondi no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt. She’s in the bag for Trump. The question now is whether she’ll cross the line that even Barr, her crooked predecessor, would not, and use the Justice Department’s staggering investigative power as an offensive weapon.

Even if the DoJ investigates but concludes it cannot bring a criminal charge, the threat to Krebs and Taylor is real. Any criminal inquiry takes an enormous toll on its subject; subpoenas fly, friends and colleagues get pulled into the grand jury, phones get seized and searched, legal costs mount, professional reputations suffer, personal ties fray. Ask anyone who has been investigated by the Justice Department but not indicted. They’ll tell you it’s a nightmare.

If Bondi does somehow convince a grand jury to indict somebody for something, Trump has unwittingly handed both Krebs and Taylor a potent defense: selective prosecution, which applies when an individual has been singled out for improper purposes. Exhibit A (for the defense): Trump’s own grand proclamations, which openly confess to his personal and political motives for ordering a Justice Department inquiry. Selective-prosecution defenses rarely succeed, often because prosecutors typically don’t commit their improper motives to paper. But this would be the rare case in which the evidence is so plain — it’s on White House letterhead, signed by the president — that a judge could hardly overlook it.

Trump has long made a habit of threatening his opponents with criminal prosecution through social-media posts and spontaneous outbursts from the lectern. Until now, it was mostly bluster, a public form of scream therapy for the capricious commander-in-chief. But now it’s in writing, from the president to the attorney general, who typically jumps to attention to serve whatever suits the boss, prosecutorial standards be darned. Trump’s dark fantasies are coming to life.

New York Magazine,David Freedlander,Wealthy Trump Donors Try to Make Sense of the Tariff Circus,Donald Trump’s wealthy backers in finance saw their wealth get hammered by the global trade war and are sharply divided about the wisdom of his tariffs.,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-donors-tariff-reaction.html,https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/222/d95/8aadd14f7173c9f6ddd9e60e5cc454c686-rep-donors-trump-tariffs.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,2025-04-11T09:00:24Z,"They were, in many cases, Donald Trumps most fervent backers: rich Wall Street types, lawyers at corporate firms, business tycoons, and tech engineers who fervently backed the president by raising an… [+7094 chars]","Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

They were, in many cases, Donald Trump’s most fervent backers: rich Wall Street types, lawyers at corporate firms, business tycoons, and tech engineers who fervently backed the president by raising and donating many millions of dollars for his election, risking the opprobrium of their fellow moneyed elites.

But after he declared a global trade war, leaving the stock market in free fall and a recession seemingly imminent, many donors found themselves earlier this week in the same position as the rest of us: squinting at Trump’s moves and trying to make sense of it all.

“I just, I just …” said one Trump donor, a New York–based banker who had been supportive of the former president since Trump first rode down the golden escalator in 2015, pausing to gather his thoughts as he rode on the Acela to Washington, D.C., last week for a fundraiser for congressional Republicans. “I just don’t really understand what the strategy here is.”

“The people speaking, L and B,” this person said, referring to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, but using their initials in case anyone overheard in business class, “it seems like they don’t really know what is going on either. But it has just been a couple of days, and I think we need to give it up a couple of weeks or a month before [Trump donors] really start to panic. There is a hope that maybe we will start to see some adjustments.”

The MAGA money class, many of whom fancy themselves knowledgeable about matters related to the markets and the global economy — and who have likely collectively lost billions of dollars in the market over the past week — were divided as Trump instituted a global tariff regime that some administration officials said was permanent and others insisted was merely a negotiating strategy, only to then call off the tariffs for 90 days while also raising tariffs further on China. Andy Sabin, the billionaire chairman of Sabin Metal Corporation, said he had no problem with tariffs in theory but that “I don’t like the way this was handled.”

“We don’t really know where this is going to go. I don’t care what anybody says; we are in uncharted territory here,” Sabin added. “And I don’t see this as a [stock] buying opportunity. Who would be a buyer right now? People are scared, and we don’t know how or when this ends.”

But even as titans of finance like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, and Home Depot founder Ken Langone warned against raising tariffs — Langone called the 46 percent on Vietnam in particular “bullshit” — on the basis of the expected economic damage they would do. Some Trump donors insisted that they and mainstream economists were wrong.

“None of these idiots understands a fucking thing about tariffs,” said Nirmal Mulye, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur, clarifying that the idiots he was referring to were “Paul Krugman and all the rest of the so-called Nobel Prize winners. America needed tariffs to compete” with China, which, he added, uses child labor and is free to pollute as it pleases. In the U.S., he said, “we can’t hire anybody if they are white or Asian.”

“There is no such thing as a free market in the world,” Mulye added, and Trump’s tariffs helped level the regulatory playing field.

When I told him on Wednesday that Trump was pausing the tariffs, however, Mulye paused.

“I think that is a mistake.”

A week of chaos provided each donor their own interpretation of events. Richard Porter, a retired corporate attorney at Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, made the analogy of the U.S. being the world’s most desirable mall, one where every other country in the world wants to set up shop. Trump, he added, is merely charging them the fair value for the space to sell.

“We are still the essential market, the market that every other country in the world needs to be in,” he said, adding that the tariffs were necessary to reshore critical industries like armaments and pharmaceuticals. “We cannot be a leading nation if other countries have this kind of leverage over us.”

Many donors saw another strategy at play: Trump’s tariffs are less about resetting global alliances and more about the coming AI revolution, which, combined with the president’s immigration crackdown, will right-size the American labor force for the future. Once the tariffs were in place, Porter predicted, investment would surge in the U.S., and by the summer of next year, Trump would preside over a “golden age” of full employment and rising incomes, at which point the current turmoil would be largely forgotten.

This was a view that echoed across MAGA. On X, Tavni Ratna, a policy adviser to the World Economic Forum, wrote a 15-post thread that was passed around Trump-friendly circles and described the escalating trade war as a “deliberate ‘detox’ to cool the economy and cut refinancing costs,” one which would ultimately lead to tax cuts and and a new global order: “Tariffs now serve as leverage to renegotiate terms based on America-First policy.”

Hal Lambert, a Republican megadonor and the founder of Point Bridge Capital, an investment-management company, said as the tariffs were being implemented that “I don’t have any problem with tariffs. I think they are necessary and ultimately they are going to cut deals with these countries and we are going to end up in a better position.”

Trump’s abrupt reversal on Wednesday afternoon did little to shake his faith in the president. “This was always the likely outcome,” he said after the pause. “However you want to frame the ending of it, Trump is going to get what he wants.” Lambert predicted that by the end of negotiations, there would be zero tariffs between most countries and the U.S.

This idea that Trump is a master negotiator who will bring the rest of the world to heel was behind much of the enthusiasm in this cohort for Trump’s tariffs, even as they watched the economy tumble.

“I think the Chinese people are smart, and I think Donald Trump is a smart person, and they are going to sit down and come to a deal,” said John Catsimatidis, the grocery-store magnate and longtime Trump friend. Catsimatidis had just gotten off the air from the radio show he hosts on WABC, a station he also owns.

“What song did we play on my show today? ‘Edge of Destruction’? We were on the edge of destruction. If we keep borrowing money and giving it away, at some point we were going to blow up. I don’t like this stock-market pain, but it is what it is, and I think in the long run we are going to be better off.”

And even among the donors who fretted about the long-term damage Trump could do to American primacy on the world financial stage, there remained a belief among the donor class that he was still better than the alternative.

“This is absolutely insane. It makes no sense whatsoever. I can’t find anyone in the banking world or the business world that supports it,” said one Trump megadonor, an attorney based in the city. “But every donor I talk to says the same thing, that this is way better than having Kamala Harris as president.”",Left

In a political landscape still adjusting to Donald Trump's return to power, Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego has emerged as a rare bright spot for Democrats — among their most unvarnished truth-tellers. Gallego, who won his Senate race in a state Trump carried, did so by outperforming Vice President Kamala Harris among key demographics and embracing a strategy that made cultural, economic and regional appeals many Democrats have thus avoided.
Gallego's message was simple: understand working-class voters, especially Latino men, and meet them where they are — both literally and figuratively.
""We're more stuck on appeasing a group of people who don't actually represent any constituencies than on taking care of people's real lives,"" Gallego said in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times Magazine in February.
He credits his appeal to his upbringing — with parents who immigrated from Colombia and Mexico, raised in poverty by a single mother, and his own journey to Harvard — as well as his fluency in the working-class vernacular Democrats too often ignore.
""Every Latino man wants a big-ass truck. There's nothing wrong with that,"" Gallego said. ""You get your troca, start your own job, and you're going to become rich, right? These are the conversations we should be having."" Troca is Spanish slang for pickup truck.
Gallego's success offers important lessons for Democrats trying to reconnect with working-class voters across racial lines. In an election where President Donald Trump made significant gains with male voters, particularly Latino men, and where masculinity was a central cultural issue, Gallego understood — unlike many of his fellow Democrats — that engaging in a culture war with men was not the right approach.
""A lot of times we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That's how we still win elections. But we don't really talk about making the lives of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they can support their families,"" Gallego said.
In that respect, his campaign hit on something of a cultural sweet spot. He visited construction sites before dawn to hand out tacos and talk politics with workers. ""We sat down with Trump supporters. We weren't afraid to talk to them,"" he said. ""And we did it repeatedly.""
Longtime Republican strategist Mike Madrid, author of The Latino Century, told Newsweek that Democrats still need to focus on the economy and address the border — issues that handed Trump the White House for the second time. While the debate over tariffs has made headlines, it's still unclear how the economy will perform and what impact that will have. The president's approval numbers have been rapidly deflating when it comes to his handling of the economy, polls continue to show.
""If the economy improves significantly under Trump, it will be hard for Democrats to beat him or the Republicans,"" Madrid said.
Gallego has also been unafraid to take positions that many Democrats have shied away from, including votes that break with party orthodoxy on immigration. He was one of only two Democratic co-sponsors of the Laken Riley Act, a Republican-backed bill that toughens immigration enforcement and was named after a Georgia nursing student who was brutally killed by an alleged member of a Venezuelan gang in the country illegally.
He also criticized the Biden administration's handling of asylum claims, saying it allowed the right to define the narrative on border chaos. ""We've been set back for years because we hesitated on asylum seekers when we knew in our guts that what was happening there was an abuse of the system,"" he told the Times.
Still, Gallego stands firm that he opposes ICE immigration raids, mass deportations without due process and abandoning pathways for Dreamers to gain citizenship — positions that have been widely supported by Democrats in recent years.
However, he has stressed that Democrats need to engage with the real concerns many voters have around immigration, especially in purplish states like Arizona, where the lines between Trump voters and Democratic supporters are increasingly blurred.
""I think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters. I think Democrats are afraid to talk to people that are going to criticize them,"" Gallego said. His willingness to confront these issues head-on has won him credibility among voters who feel neglected or talked down to by political elites.
A major part of Gallego's critique stems from what he sees as a disconnect between Democratic leadership and the Latino communities they claim to represent. This was an issue that became apparent during the campaign, according to Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University.
""Hispanics are increasingly behaving like the general electorate,"" Gamarra said. ""The economy is the main issue, followed by concerns unrelated to immigration. Second- and third-generation Hispanics are also behaving more like their American counterparts, sharing similar cultural preferences.""
This shift is a reality that Elizabeth Vaquera, director of the Cisneros Hispanic Leadership Institute at George Washington University, believes Democrats must acknowledge. ""We need to reframe the idea that Latinos are difficult to engage,"" Vaquera said. ""The voting gap comes at the point of registration, not interest.""
For many younger Latinos, cultural cues no longer come from the traditional Spanish-language institutions that shaped their parents' upbringings. Instead, figures like Joe Rogan — who have large followings across demographics — are more likely to influence views on politics, masculinity and the economy.
Gallego has implicitly acknowledged this shift, emphasizing pride, work, and aspirational success. His messaging didn't focus on taxing the rich or portraying them as enemies; it wasn't condescending or bureaucratic or focused on ""economic security.""
It was about abundance — to use a term popular on the left — providing to their families, improving their lives, and offering something familiar.
""People who are working class, poor, don't necessarily look at the ultra-rich as their competitors. They want to be rich someday. And so they don't necessarily fault the rich for being rich,"" he said.
Gallego's approach, as Democratic analyst Ruy Teixeira writes in his newsletter The Liberal Patriot, is exactly what the party needs — a focus on ""abundance"" for today. While many Democrats support policies that could reduce bills in the future, they may also raise the cost of the suburban lifestyle that many people, particularly upwardly mobile Latinos, aspire to now. Teixeira argues that this ideal — the affordable suburban dream — is how ""abundance"" should be defined.
""Call it the 'big-ass truck problem.' Any abundance approach in a populist era needs to reckon with this problem. Otherwise, like the other Democratic approaches, it will fall short among the populist working class.""",Center

A judge will consider Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman’s request to withdraw his predecessor George Gascon’s motion to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez on Friday, days before their resentencing hearing is set to take place.
Friday's hearing is set for 10 a.m. local time, when the brothers are expected to appear remotely.
Hochman announced on Wednesday that his office has filed a reply on the resentencing matter, saying he does not agree with the resentencing, but is prepared to move forward. The brothers' attorneys have argued they should have been convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, in which case they would already have been released from prison.

Hochman's office said that after ""a thorough and exhaustive review of over tens of thousands of pages of trial transcripts, thousands of pages of prison records, and hundreds of hours of videotaped trial testimony,"" his office is prepared to move forward with the hearing on the Court’s initiation of resentencing proceedings for the Menendez brothers, but are requesting that the prior District Attorney’s motion for resentencing be withdrawn.
Joseph Menendez, who goes by his middle name Lyle, and younger brother Erik Menendez have been in California prisons since 1996, serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for their parents' 1989 slayings.
Before losing his bid for reelection in November, former district attorney George Gascon asked the court to resentence the brothers to life with parole instead of the current sentence of life without the possibility of parole.
Hochman has opposed resentencing, but said his office is ready to proceed with the resentencing hearing, which he said could still happen even if the judge agrees to withdraw the Gascon motion.  
California criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool, who is not involved in the case, told Fox News Digital that no matter what comes out of Friday's hearing, the Menendez brothers' fate will be up to a judge.

""At the end of the day, I think the judge is going to grant Hochman's request to remove Gascon motion to support resentencing, but what we really need to have is a ruling by the trial judge,"" Claypool explained. ""So in other words, it doesn't matter really what the LA County DA says, whether it's Hochman's position or the prior DA Gascon's decision. It's ultimately up to this judge to make a decision on resentencing, irrespective of what Hochmon is requesting to be done.""
Two of the brothers' older relatives had already provided testimony at a November hearing as a precaution and the only relative against the brother's release, their uncle Milton Anderson, died last month at age 90.
Subject to the court’s ruling, a resentencing hearing is tentatively scheduled for April 17 and 18. If that goes forward, prosecutors are expecting the defense to call several Menendez family members who support resentencing.  
The hearing was postponed due to the impact of recent wildfires on the parties' extensive preparations. 
Claypool, who is based in Los Angeles County, believes that resentencing hearing is ""a political tug-of-war"" between Hochman and Gov. Gavin Newsom, more than anything else.
""The reason I say that is because Gavin Newsom has already requested weeks ago that the California Parole Board conduct what's called a risk assessment on the Menendez brothers. Why is that important? Because that portends that Newsom is likely to grant clemency if this judge doesn't grant resentencing. And in many respects, I believe that Newsom did that on purpose to put some implied pressure on this judge to grant resentencing,"" Claypool said. 
Hochman's office has said that despite the ""defense arguing that this decision is political, such an argument is devoid of merit.""
""Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials.""
""The basis for this withdrawal request is that the prior DA’s motion did not examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and taken complete responsibility for their crimes by continuing for the past over 30 years to lie about their claims of self-defense, that is, their fear that their mother and father were going to kill them the night of Aug. 20, 1989, justifying the brutal murders of their parents with shotgun blasts through the back of their father’s head, a point-blank blast through their mother’s face, and shots to their kneecaps to stage it as a Mafia killing,"" Hochman said. 
""As a full examination of the record reveals, the Menendez brothers have never come clean over the past three decades and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle’s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.""
FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X
Hochman's office also told Fox News Digital that this has nothing to do with politics and that there is ""no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor.""
""Politics was one of the chief driving forces behind the timing of the prior District Attorney's decision to file a resentencing motion in the Menendez case, coming 12 days before the election instead of eight months earlier when he first received the resentencing request,"" Hochman said.
""The facts and the law — not politics — are now what drives DA Hochman’s request to withdraw that motion as laid out in detail in the over 85-page response filed on March 10, 2025. There is no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor. The DA has done his job involving a thorough and detailed review of the facts and the law, and the DA assumes the Governor will honor his similar obligations.""
Hochman has said that it is up to the court to factor in whether the ""lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions"" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.
""Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,"" Hochman said. 
MENENDEZ BROTHERS RESENTENCING: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Claypool said he believes that Hochman knows deep down that they will lose this battle due to the ""public sentiment flowing in favor of the Menendez brothers getting a second chance.""
""Hochman has to come out and vigorously oppose this because that is his mantra. That is his campaign message, but I think deep down he knows that it's not about winning or losing right now, for Hochman, it's about where does he stand politically on this issue,"" Claypool shared. 
GET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB
The Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition, a family-led initiative advocating for the release of Erik and Lyle Menendez, issued a statement prior to Friday's hearing saying they are ""confident that legal standards, not politics, will prevail as the judge considers DA Hochman’s reversal request.""
""Erik and Lyle have apologized, taken responsibility, and expressed sincere remorse, again and again, with no underlining motive other than to grow, mature, and rehabilitate,"" said Tamara Goodell, cousin of Erik and Lyle Menendez. ""They recognize the wide-scale impact their actions have had on us, their family. Since then, we have seen their relentless commitment to emotional growth, earning degrees and uplifting those around them. That is the definition of rehabilitation in my eyes.""
Hochman previously told ABC News that he would consider resentencing ""if they sincerely and unequivocally admit, for the first time in over 30 years, the full range of their criminal activity and all the lies that they have told about it.""
The district attorney wrote in his motion that he believes the Menendez brothers ""have repeatedly lied about the case, their parents, and their interactions with witnesses.""
The brothers claim they shot their father, former RCA Records executive Jose Menendez, in self-defense, arguing they thought he was going to kill them after they warned him they planned to expose him as a child sex abuser. They also killed their mother, Mary ""Kitty"" Menendez, who was sitting next to Jose eating ice cream in their Beverly Hills living room when they opened fire.

Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors couldn't agree on their fate. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed. 
If the judge decides to resentence the Menendez brothers, it will then be up to the state parole board to consider their release.   
They are already scheduled to appear before the board on June 13 as part of a comprehensive risk assessment report ordered by Newsom, who is considering the brothers’ clemency request – a separate potential path to freedom.

""Be careful what you wish for, because I think, in the end, the way this plays out is the Menendez brothers are likely to be granted parole either through resentencing or clemency from Newsom,"" Claypool said.

LAS VEGAS -- The U.S. government now wants a former FBI informant who fabricated a story about former President Joe Biden and his son Hunter accepting bribes to be released from prison while he appeals his conviction, it was revealed Thursday in court records.

Alexander Smirnov, 44, was sentenced to six years in prison in early January after pleading guilty in Los Angeles federal court to tax evasion and lying to the FBI about the phony bribery scheme, which was described by prosecutors at the time as an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

Smirnov had been prosecuted by former Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who resigned in January just days before President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term. Smirnov's case was reassigned Thursday to a new federal prosecutor, court records show, who jointly filed a motion the same day with Smirnov's attorneys seeking his release.

In the motion, the U.S. government said it will review its ""theory of the case.” The motion also notes that Smirnov's release from custody would allow him to receive proper treatment for health issues related to his eyes.

Smirnov has been in custody since February 2024. He was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after returning to the U.S. from overseas.

A hearing on the motion was not immediately scheduled Thursday.

Smirnov, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, falsely claimed to his FBI handler that around 2015, executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each.

The explosive claim in 2020 came after Smirnov expressed ""bias” about Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors at the time. In reality, investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 — after Biden's term as vice president.

Authorities said Smirnov's false claim “set off a firestorm in Congress” when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Biden, who won the presidency over Trump in 2020. The Biden administration dismissed the impeachment effort as a “stunt.”

Weiss also brought gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden, who was supposed to be sentenced in December after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to tax charges. But he was pardoned by his father, who said he believed “raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”

CNN —

Four House lawmakers from battleground districts will field questions from American voters Thursday.

Republicans Mike Lawler and Ryan Mackenzie and Democrats Jahana Hayes and Derek Tran will address a live studio audience made up of Republicans, Democrats and independents that includes constituents from each member’s district.

Lawler and Mackenzie are part of a Republican majority in the House that is attempting to pass President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, which includes new money for immigration enforcement, a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, steep spending cuts and more energy drilling. Both voted in favor of adopting a budget blueprint earlier Thursday – a critical first step toward advancing the president’s legislative priorities.

Hayes, a former educator, and Tran, a military veteran, are among Democrats opposed to Trump’s cuts to government agencies and the federal workforce.

Here’s a look at the lawmakers and the districts they represent:

Mike Lawler

Lawler is a two-term Republican congressman representing New York’s Hudson Valley, one of just three across the country that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris for president and sent a Republican to the US House.

He served in New York local politics for years before he was elected in 2022 to Congress and was reelected in 2024, despite facing some controversy.

Lawler, who portrays himself as a moderate, is part of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and the bipartisan caucus that advocates for the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction.

He is weighing a run for New York governor.

He has called for no cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and has said he will opposed a national abortion ban.

Ryan Mackenzie

Mackenzie, a Pennsylvania Republican, flipped a key congressional seat in a swing state, narrowly beating Democrat Susan Wild by half a percentage point in the 2024 election.

He served in the Pennsylvania state House before he ran for Congress.

The Lehigh Valley congressman has introduced a bill package that aims to expand paid family and medical leave, double the child tax credit and expands the adoption tax credit and creates a matching credit for in vitro fertilization.

He has joined a bipartisan bill aimed at helping families access affordable childcare and bipartisan legislation to tackle maternal deaths

Jahana Hayes

A Democrat from Connecticut, Hayes was a public school history teacher for 15 years, winning the distinction of 2016 National Teacher of the Year, before she joined Congress in 2019.

Hayes, a Democrat now in her fourth term in Congress, has been critical of the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.

Hayes is the first Black congresswoman elected to represent the state of Connecticut.

Derek Tran

Tran, a California Democrat, is also new to Washington. He’s a freshman congressman who flipped a key seat in California to narrow the party’s margins within House Republicans’ majority.

Having never held political office before, Tran defeated GOP incumbent Rep. Michelle Steel in the 2024 race for California’s 45th District by 653 votes.

Tran, who is Vietnamese American, represents a predominantly Asian American district in Orange County that includes Little Saigon.

An Army veteran, Tran’s first piece of legislation introduced was a bill that aimed to reinstate veterans who were dismissed from federal employment without cause.

Chinese officials acknowledged behind closed doors at a December meeting that their government was responsible for a series of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to a Wall Street Journal report based on information from people familiar with the matter.
The news comes as the two countries continue to spar over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and reciprocated and upped by President Xi Jinping.
In an exclusive, the Wall Street Journal reported that those who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed Chinese officials connected the cyberattacks on U.S. ports, airports, utilities and other important targets to America’s support for Taiwan.
The report noted that Biden administration officials learned of the discovery first hand during a summit in Geneva, as their Chinese counterparts blamed the campaign, referred to as Volt Typhoon, on a criminal organization.

Chinese officials also accused the U.S. of pointing blame at China based on their imagination.
A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital the State Department has made clear to Beijing that the U.S. will continue to take actions in response to Chinese malicious cyber activity targeting the U.S.
""Chinese cyber threats are some of the gravest and most persistent threats to U.S. national security,"" the spokesperson said. ""The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to safeguard U.S. critical infrastructure from irresponsible and reckless cyberattacks from Beijing. President Trump is committed to protecting the American people and U.S. critical infrastructure from these threats.""
The Chinese Embassy told FOX Business that China ""firmly opposes"" the smear attacks against it without any factual basis.

""Cyberspace is characterized by strong virtuality, difficulty in tracing origins, and diverse actors, making the tracing of cyberattacks a complex technical issue,"" Embassy spokesperson Mr. Liu Pengyu said. ""We hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude when characterizing cyber incidents, basing their conclusions on sufficient evidence rather than unfounded speculation and accusations.
""The US needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,"" he added.
The Biden administration warned state leaders in March 2024 that cyberattacks by hackers linked to Iran and China could take down water systems across the U.S. if cybersecurity measures were not taken out of precaution.

Then Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael S. Regan and Jake Sullivan, the assistant to Biden for national security affairs, said in an email to state governors that cyberattacks were targeting water and wastewater systems throughout the U.S.
In the letter, the two Biden administration officials said the attacks could disrupt clean and safe drinking water and impose significant costs on affected communities.
While one attack was linked to Iran, the other threat came from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hacker group, Volt Typhoon, which compromised information technology of critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water facilities in the U.S. and its territories.

As U.S. officials issued warnings about Volt Typhoon’s effort, they also accused the PRC of attempting to get into U.S. computer networks in an effort to unleash cyberattacks during any unforeseen conflicts in the future.
The FBI said in December that hackers in Beijing infiltrated networks of ""multiple"" telecommunication companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of ""a limited number of individuals."" But the targets, the FBI noted in December, were Americans involved in government and politics.
A federal investigation uncovered a massive cyber-espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed in December that at least eight U.S. telecom companies had been affected by the hacking spree.

A heated email exchange between Richard Grenell, the interim head of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and one of its artists left the musician “shocked” by what she called a “bizarre” interaction.

Grenell seemed “aggressively upset” during the exchange on Tuesday, musician Yasmin Williams told CNN in an interview Thursday. She had initially emailed Grenell, who is also currently serving as President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions, about concerns she’s heard from other musicians and former patrons about the center’s moves to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; cancel certain shows; and eliminate board members.

“I was shocked at first if anything because, honestly, I thought it was fake. I thought it was just like, is this ChatGPT? Like, what is this?” Williams said. “He’s not responding like I assume the executive director, interim or not, of the Kennedy Center would respond to an email. It was just bizarre.”

The musician questioned Grenell about recent changes, writing over email, “Does the President actually care about artists cancelling shows at the Kennedy Center? What, if anything, has changed about the Kennedy Center regarding hiring practices, performance booking, and staffing?”

Grenell, a longtime Trump confidant already serving in multiple administration positions who Trump named to the director role in February, said in response in the email thread, “Let me ask you this question, would you play for Republicans or would you boycott if Republicans came to your show?”

Williams told CNN Grenell’s response “made absolutely no sense.”

CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center and Grenell for comment.

The exchange puts Trump’s aggressive push to reshape the Kennedy Center into sharp focus, as the Washington, DC-based performing arts complex has been thrust into the middle of the culture wars.

“Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP. The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation,” the president posted on social media in February.

The president has targeted the center in a slew of changes, including dismissing its board and installing himself as its chairman in February.

Artists including Issa Rae, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds have resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space in response to the changes, while the center has canceled performances, including the children’s musical “Finn.”

During the exchange, Williams wrote back in an email that she has played for Republicans before and that “boycotting anything because Republicans exist and may be at a show of mine makes no sense to me.” Grenell responded that the artists who cancelled their shows did so because they couldn’t be in the presence of Republicans and advised the musician to not “be gullible” and “swallow what the media tells you.”

“Your people also booed and harassed the vice president who simply wanted to enjoy music with his wife for a night. Who is the intolerant one?” Grenell continued, referring to an incident last month in which Vice President JD Vance was booed as he entered a concert hall at the Kennedy Center.

In another email, Grenell told the musician, “Yes, I cut the DEI bullshit because we can’t afford to pay people for fringe and niche programming that the public won’t support. Yes, I cut the people making over $500k a year because we are in debt.”

Williams, who is Black, criticized his comments on DEI as “egregiously unprofessional and ridiculous.”

The musician said current and former employees who recently worked at the center have reached out to her since her Instagram post detailing the email exchange went viral, telling her it was “really nice and refreshing to see how they talk to us and how they treat us come to light,” she said.

The Kennedy Center is among a number of cultural institutions Trump has targeted as part of a broader push to influence American arts and culture since the start of his second term. He directed his administration last month to scrutinize and threaten funding for the Smithsonian Institution to force federal museums to “remove improper ideology” from their exhibits. And he specifically targeted the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum for carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.

The president also signed an order last month directing the Institution of Museum and Library Services, among several other government entities, to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.”

Trump's tariff reality sets in

The major U.S. stock indexes dropped sharply on Thursday as President Donald Trump continues to pursue a tariff agenda capable of throwing the global economy into chaos, Rob Wile reports.

Stocks had staged a historic rally on Wednesday after Trump revised his tariff plans, appearing to back down from some of the highest rates on many U.S. trading partners.

But he has also escalated tariffs on China and did not ease tariffs on Canada or Mexico, the largest U.S. trading partners. A revised analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale University found that consumers will still face an overall tariff rate of 25.3% — the highest since 1903.

The S&P 500 is now off about 14% from its February highs.

Even with most tariffs targeting individual nations now ostensibly on hold, Trump’s plan still entails the United States’ average effective tariff rate climbing considerably, as a baseline fee of 10% for all imports and 145% for ones from China snap into place — suggesting the cost of imports are still likely to surge.

Trump also still plans to impose “sectoral” tariffs on entire swaths of goods, including pharmaceuticals and lumber.

What Trump is saying: Trump said he was not tracking a fall in the stock market today as he met with his Cabinet secretaries, Katherine Doyle reports.

He acknowledged that his tariffs will pose “transition problems,” but said that, ultimately, “it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”

“We’re doing again what we should have done many years ago,” Trump added.

Asked if he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump declined to say. He instead played down the escalating trade war with Beijing, saying that he believes the U.S. will reach a deal “that’s very good for both countries.”

What the polls are saying: Kloe Zheng notes that a recent survey from Pew Research Center found that a majority (52%) of Americans said tariffs on Chinese goods will be bad for the U.S. and for them personally.

What Democrats are saying: Congressional Democrats are questioning whether Trump and his allies may have improperly acted on his suggestion Wednesday that it was a “great time to buy” stocks shortly before announcing he was cutting back on some of his new tariffs, Kate Santaliz, Rob Wile and Rebecca Shabad report.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats “need to get to the bottom of the possible stock manipulation that is unfolding before the American people, including what if any advanced knowledge did members of the House Republican Conference have of Trump’s decision to pause the reckless tariffs that he put into place.”

More on tariffs and the economy:

Plurality of voters are wary of CEOs’ support for Trump, and a similar share say media is too critical

By Faith Wardwell

A recent national NBC News poll found a near-majority of voters see CEOs of large corporations as being too supportive of President Trump, while about the same share of voters said they think the news media is too critical of him.

The poll, conducted March 7-11 (before the latest announcements and then partial pullback of global tariffs, which sparked alarm from business leaders) showed 49% of registered voters saying CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, with another 29% saying the executives are dealing with him “in the right way.” A plurality of voters (46%) also say they think the media is too critical of the president, while another 24% say the media is dealing with him in the right way; 25% say outlets are too supportive of him.

Trump has surrounded himself with billionaires and tech tycoons since the beginning of his second term, starting with lining the Capitol rotunda with some of the world’s wealthiest men during his inauguration ceremony. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos both got prominent seats at the event alongside Elon Musk, whom Trump has described as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency.

Meanwhile, Trump’s team has ramped up its trademark anti-media rhetoric compared to his first term — banning The Associated Press from the White House and Air Force One for refusing to adopt the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, accusing outlets of corruption and rolling out a series of lawsuits against news organizations.

The NBC News poll found 49% of Republicans say CEOs are dealing with the president in the right way, while 14% of Trump’s party say CEOs are too supportive. On the question of the media’s handling of Trump, 84% of Republicans say news outlets are too critical of the president, and just 8% say the media is dealing with Trump in the right way.

The picture is reversed across the aisle, with 83% of Democrats saying they see CEOs as being too supportive of Trump and 66% of independents in agreement.

And a near-majority of Democrats (49%) say the news media is too supportive of Trump. Independents appeared split on the question, with 40% saying the media is dealing with Trump in the right way and another 35% of the group saying the media is too critical.

For months, Democratic elected officials have been trying to figure out a compelling message on Donald Trump’s agenda that will gratify the grassroots Democratic demand for vocal and united opposition. At the moment, the headlines are full of extremely high-profile turmoil involving Trump’s “Liberation Day” agenda of tariffs and trade warfare. It is likely getting the attention of not only politically active people but anyone whose investments or 401(k) accounts are affected by equity markets. And there is zero question that rank-and-file Democrats hate what Trump is trying to do with greater unanimity than on any of the other things they hate about Trump 2.0. If you have any doubts about that, check out the very latest, post–Liberation Day findings from Quinnipiac:

97 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of independents and 44 percent of Republicans think the tariffs will hurt the U.S. economy in the short-term. Forty-six percent of Republicans, 19 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats think the tariffs will help the U.S. economy in the short-term. …

95 percent of Democrats, 57 percent of independents and 10 percent of Republicans think the tariffs will hurt the U.S. economy in the long-term. Eighty-seven percent of Republicans, 35 percent of independents and 3 percent of Democrats think the tariffs will help the U.S. economy in the long-term.

You don’t see polling that conclusive very often, even in this era of polarization. But beyond the simple fact that the Democratic base instinctively hates Trump’s tariff agenda, this should strike Democratic politicians as a heaven-sent opportunity to expose Trump on an issue of maximum vulnerability: the cost of living. One would think, given the crucial importance of this issue to his victory over Joe Biden last November, that the 47th president would do anything imaginable to avoid a spike in consumer prices anytime soon. But instead, Trump is courting exactly the worst kind of disaster, and voters across the board recognize it:

Most Americans are bracing for higher prices on a wide range of consumer goods following President Donald Trump’s move to impose sweeping new tariffs on imports from most of the world, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The three-day poll, which concluded on Sunday, found that 73% of respondents said they thought prices in the next six months would increase for the items they buy every day after the new taxes on almost all imports took effect.

So in recognition of this potentially earth-shaking own goal by Trump, the product of his economic ignorance and long-held ideological views, Democratic elected officials should be issuing a trumpet call of great volume and total clarity, right?

Check out this description in the Washington Post of a speech by one of the Democratic Party’s brightest stars and see if it reflects the total opposition to Trump’s tariff agenda that is clearly called for at this particular moment:

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, sought Wednesday to distinguish herself from fellow Democrats who have been strongly criticizing President Donald Trump and his tariffs, offering a more nuanced assessment during a speech emphasizing bipartisanship in Washington.

The speech came ahead of a meeting with Trump at the White House, her second since Trump returned to office.

Whitmer made clear that she disagreed with Trump’s sweeping and abrupt use of tariffs, saying it has been “really tough” on her state and the auto industry that powers its economy. But she withheld more pointed criticism of the president, saying she understands the “motivation” behind his tariffs and agrees that Americans “need to make more stuff in America.”

Now, as it happens, Whitmer made her mixed message immeasurably worse by immediately going into a private Oval Office meeting with Trump that the president (either craftily or fortuitously) turned into a photo op in which the Michigan governor stood there while he signed some particularly obnoxious executive orders. It’s not exactly the picture of vicious hand-to-hand combat with the authoritarian of the White House that grassroots Democrats have been demanding. But Whitmer’s not alone in struggling to bring herself to blast Trump’s tariffs entirely, as Jonathan Chait quickly pointed out at The Atlantic:

Two days after President Donald Trump’s shambolic “Liberation Day” announcement, which set off a full-scale economic meltdown, House Democrats released a video response. It was oddly sedate, almost academic in its nuance. The video featured Representative Chris Deluzio, from western Pennsylvania, who calmly intoned, “A wrong-for-decades consensus on ‘free trade’ has been a race to the bottom” and “Tariffs are a powerful tool. They can be used strategically, or they can be misused.”

As the American public was screaming, “Please, God, no!” the Democrats were calmly whispering, “Yes, but.”

From a purely historical perspective, this anti-anti-protectionism is astounding. Until very recently, basic support for free trade (albeit sometimes with exceptions) was the oldest continuing policy tradition of the Democratic Party. Every Democratic president from Martin Van Buren to Barack Obama favored expanded global trade to create new markets and reduce consumer prices. But, as Chait observed, that changed with Joe Biden, who embraced “a decade-old strategy designed to co-opt Trump’s appeal to working-class voters by backing away from the party’s general support for free trade under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama” (and, I’d add, under Wilson, FDR, Truman, JFK, LBJ, and Carter). This reversal was reinforced by multiple factors, including the longtime protectionism of manufacturing unions, the hostility to globalization among progressive activists, and the pivotal role Rust Belt swing states have played in the politics of the Trump era. It’s no coincidence that Whitmer represents one of those states, and one in which Democrats have long embraced trade restrictions.

But maintaining anti-anti-protectionism in the current Trump 2.0 emergency is incredibly shortsighted. Democrats need not declare themselves 100 percent free traders in order to 100 percent deplore what Trump is doing, instead of tut-tutting that he’s doing a good thing in a bad way. Trump’s innate 19th-century protectionist instincts will always create enormous pressures for falling economic growth and rising consumer prices; indeed, the ultimate economic nightmare of stagflation is precisely what some economists consider the most likely consequence of a MAGA trade war.

If Democrats believe half of what they are saying about the threat to democracy Trump 2.0 represents, they’ll recognize that a loud pushback against Trump’s tariffs is absolutely the best way to undermine his political position and divide Republicans, a majority of whose elected officials are stone free traders in the Reagan-Bush tradition. Democrat thinkers and political practitioners have plenty of time to figure out exactly what their own international economic policies will be if they regain the White House in 2028. But if they don’t take full advantage of the present opportunity to unite grassroots Democrats and inflation-hating voters generally and exploit Trump’s unforced errors on trade policy, they will have nobody but themselves to blame if power continues to remain elusive.",Left

A tariff reprieve from President Donald Trump sent global markets soaring on Wednesday, with the White House saying it’s been in touch with dozens of countries about striking deals, lining up calls and meetings in the coming weeks.

But one country was conspicuously absent from any outreach: China

As the rest of the world received a 90-day respite, Trump escalated tariffs on China, saying the US will now charge an extra 145% on all Chinese goods that arrive in the US. In response, Beijing ratcheted up its own tariffs on American goods Friday to 125%, and the country’s leader — who Trump is urgently working to engage — warned China was “not afraid” of a prolonged trade conflict.

In private discussions hours before China announced new retaliatory tariffs, the Trump administration warned Chinese officials against such a move, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

The Chinese were also told – once again – that Chinese President Xi Jinping should request a call with US President Donald Trump.

Instead, US officials woke up to news of increased Chinese tariffs and no request for a leader level call. Xi also made comments that only dug him in further.

“For over 70 years, China’s development has relied on self-reliance and hard work — never on handouts from others, and it is not afraid of any unjust suppression,” Xi said according to state broadcaster CCTV during his meeting with the Spanish prime minister.

An unprecedented trade war between the world’s two economic superpowers is quickly taking shape, with both countries waiting for the other to blink.

Two senior White House officials tell CNN that the US will not reach out to China first. Trump has told his team that China must be the first to make the move, as the White House believes it is Beijing that has chosen to retaliate and further escalate the trade war.

That stance has been conveyed to Beijing for roughly two months, with Trump’s team clearly telling Chinese officials that Xi should request a call with Trump. But Beijing has repeatedly refused to arrange a leader-level phone call, according to three sources familiar with the official communications.

One hurdle, Trump’s team believes, is Xi’s desire not to be seen as weak by making the first move and approaching the US for talks.

Trump, who envisions a grand bargain with China that increases US exports, cracks down on fentanyl exports and restructures TikTok for US users, has suggested Beijing would come around.

“China wants to make a deal. They just don’t know how quite to go about it,” Trump said on Wednesday during an event at the White House. “You know, it’s one of those things they don’t know quite – They’re proud people.”

Looking for the proper channel

But for months, US and Chinese leaders have been talking past each other, allowing relations to sour as each country’s overtures go unanswered.

Behind the scenes, official channels at the working level are active, but high-level dialogue has not been happening. Meanwhile, unofficial channels have proven unproductive, according to three sources briefed on the situation, paving the way for a game of economic chicken with a costly and uncertain end.

China’s reliance on strict protocol and desire to prepare Xi for any call of this magnitude is fundamentally at odds with how Trump does business, some current and former officials say, which they point to as the main hangup in trying to get productive talks underway.

China has been trying to set up a back channel, like it had with President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, but so far that effort has been unsuccessful. The US objection, according to officials: The Trump administration has balked at China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi serving as the interlocutor, suggesting that Wang is not close enough to Xi’s inner circle and cannot be trusted.

Chinese officials have been presented with the specific names of people that the Trump White House would like to engage with instead, but China won’t budge, sources say.

Further inflaming tensions, the Chinese readout of a call between Wang and Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year appeared to misrepresent the contents of the call, Rubio later said.

“That didn’t happen, at least not on the call, or at least maybe their interpreter didn’t want to interpret it that way,” Rubio said of the Chinese claim that Rubio was warned not to overstep himself.

While some communication between the sides has been brokered by China’s ambassador to the US, the dearth of a principal-level channel has been problematic in arranging a call that the Trump administration says is necessary.

Two senior White House officials told CNN that Trump would be happy for communication to begin below the leader-level if it brought about results.

Despite Trump officials publicly saying that Trump will dictate his engagement with Xi – National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC Thursday morning that Trump “will decide” when conversations begin – it is clear that the ball is in China’s court for the time being.

At least that’s how Trump officials see it. But that’s not the view in Beijing.

“The door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday. “If the US chooses confrontation, China will respond in kind. Pressure, threats, and blackmail are not the right ways to deal with China.”

Amid the standoff, the White House has sought to prioritize trade deals with Japan, South Korea and Vietnam in order to pressure Beijing, a senior White House official said.

Current and former US officials aren’t ruling out the possibility of putting in place an unexpected preparation channel for a possible Xi-Trump call, but former US officials say the key is ensuring the Chinese they aren’t sending Xi in for an ambush — especially after the tongue-lashing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky received in the Oval Office.

“The Chinese in any case, are reluctant to put their leader in the position that Zelensky found himself in,” said Danny Russel, a former assistant secretary of State for East Asia and currently vice president of the Asian Society Policy Institute. “They want to ensure that some of the groundwork is laid for a meeting, and that there’s some ground rules established.”

‘Mutually-assured destruction’

Chinese officials have sought avenues to reach Trump directly, often through business leaders who have his ear.

When Xi dispatched Vice President Han Zheng to Washington as the highest-ranking Chinese envoy to ever attend a presidential swearing-in, Han also took a meeting with Elon Musk.

The billionaire Tesla CEO has business in China and has also wielded enormous influence in the early days of the Trump administration. Chinese officials had hoped to establish more direct lines of communication with the new Trump administration, using Musk as an intermediary, one person familiar with the matter said. But so far, those attempts haven’t been fruitful.

China has considered kneecapping the operations of blue-chip US companies in China such as Apple, Tesla, Caterpillar and Starbucks. Ultimately, according to two sources briefed on the discussions, Beijing backed off that idea – worried that Chinese consumers would revolt, and the Chinese Communist Party could lose the potential for lucrative executive backchannels.

But the CCP is still weighing strategic options to hit back against Washington beyond simply raising import duties. China will likely begin buying soybeans and agricultural products from Brazil instead of the US heartland, as it did during Trump’s first-term trade war.

“Look at where they’re blacklisting US companies, hitting US farmers, cutting us off from critical minerals – that’s a toolkit that they’re very comfortable wielding,” said Melanie Hart, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. “They have experimented with it in many other countries. They’ve been developing it for years. They have a bunker that they’ve been building for this moment.”

Asked what pain threshold either country is willing to bear, sources in touch with both governments couldn’t say. But one thing is clear: How far either country moves into leveraging non-tariff weapons to fight back could determine how dangerous the economic conflict could become.

Beijing has banned the export of a handful of rare earth minerals required for manufacturing certain goods. Moving to ban the export of all rare earth minerals or selling off the mountain of US Treasury bonds it’s amassed would be seen as taking the conflict to the next level.

“If China moves to fully throttle the US economy, all shackles are off,” said a former US official briefed on the state of play. “A trade war of that magnitude is an act of war.”

Which country has more leverage in such a conflict depends on who you ask. Peter Navarro, Trump’s uber-hawk, has suggested Beijing can’t afford to escalate to that level. Others suggest that’s a naive depiction of an authoritarian leader wielding the full power of a non-market economy subsidized by his government.

“That’s absolutely incorrect,” one source in touch with both governments suggested of Navarro’s belief. “This is going to be mutually assured destruction.”

Some experts suggest it’s Xi who has the upper hand, having bolstered his political standing at home and earning more room to maneuver before engaging Trump.

“Xi Jinping is in a much stronger political position as a result of the perceived attacks by the Trump administration, and he is in a better position to convince the Chinese people to absorb whatever economic pain the tariffs may cause,” Russel said.

Matt Pottinger, who served as Trump’s deputy national security advisor, and Liza Tobin, who served as his China director on the National Security Council, described the divide in the Free Press as a “messy breakup” and a “zero-sum contest” whose settlement will bring consequences for the rest of the world. The superpowers, they said, are evenly matched – but have different goals.

“While Trump has seized the upper hand in the trade war, Xi is gaining ground in areas that may be even more consequential: artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and the military might required to seize the most important piece of real estate in the world – Taiwan.”

Trump’s first term regrets

During Trump’s time out of office after his loss in 2020, he frequently brooded about the shortcomings of the trade agreements he struck with China during his first term. While he enjoyed a warm relationship with Xi, including a Xi visit to Mar-a-Lago and a splashy Trump visit to Beijing in 2017, their partnership soured in the latter years of his first term.

Trump has bemoaned what he said were weak officials who allowed China to renege on some the agreements it made to purchase large amounts of American goods, including agricultural products. China has cited the Covid pandemic as the reason it did not fulfill the terms of the deal.

Back in office, Trump has discussed striking a more wide-ranging deal with China that would extend beyond trade to other areas of potential cooperation, such as new investments and commitments by China to buy more American products. Complicating that effort is the fact that a first-term trade deal aimed at selling more to China has yielded little result, and Trump’s hawkish national security team previously has expressed reservations about letting Beijing invest more in the US.

Trump also came into office vowing to crack down on fentanyl coming from China to the US. In his first days in office, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on China – along with threatened and tariffs on Canada and Mexico – citing the role of Chinese suppliers in the fentanyl trade.

Shortly after a conversation between Trump and Xi in mid-January, the CCP submitted a proposal related to curbing fentanyl production to the US Embassy in Beijing. The embassy did not respond to the proposal, which it privately derided. Beijing was furious, according to the source familiar with the two governments.

Last week, Beijing came forward with a more substantial offer, after the administration had been pushing them to do so. But it remains to be seen whether Trump would seriously consider that proposal – and any movement toward a TikTok deal – as a way to knock down tariffs that have risen exponentially and cleaved the two countries’ economies.

“Might Trump’s dealmaking instinct reassert itself and overtake his decoupling instinct?” Pottinger and Tobin asked. “But a comprehensive ‘grand bargain’ that sets aside the US-China arch-rivalry has never been more distant.”

CHINA LAUNCHES LARGE MILITARY DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN TO ISSUE 'SEVERE WARNING'
Beijing has long looked to assert its dominance over Taiwan as it aims to ""reunify"" the island with mainland China in a move the West and Taipei have warned is against Taiwan’s wishes and would disturb the region’s status quo.
Taiwan identifies as a sovereign nation. However, it is officially recognized by China, the United Nations and the U.S. as part of the ""One China"" policy – though the U.S. has increasingly warned Beijing against disrupting regional stability by forcibly ""reunifying"" the island with the mainland. 
""While the [People’s Liberation Army] PLA attempts to intimidate the people of Taiwan and demonstrate coercive capabilities, these actions are backfiring, drawing increased global attention and accelerating Taiwan's own defense preparations,"" Paparo said.

But it is not only China’s military posture toward Taiwan that concerns top military commanders.

The Indo-Pacific commander warned that China is outstripping the U.S. in the production of fighters at a rate of 1.2 to 1, and warned that the U.S. is falling behind when it comes to shipbuilding, as well as some missile and space-based capabilities.

Carney said, “Pat Buchanan, really, was pretty formative for me. He, correctly, convinced me that America’s post-Cold War interventionism was crazy. So, I opposed — I was a kid at the time — but I opposed our toppling of the government of Panama, I opposed the incursion that we did in Somalia — I still can’t get anybody to explain what the heck we were doing during the ‘Black Hawk Down’ days in Somalia why were we there. I opposed the bombing of Serbia. I opposed the overthrow of the government of Haiti. We had become crazily interventionist…and I opposed the first Gulf War…and this was all Pat Buchanan’s influence, he was out there saying, we should be looking out for America first. We shouldn’t become the policeman of the world, and he had the same philosophy on trade, that we needed a trade policy that worked for America, just like we needed a national security policy that worked for America.”

He continued, “And, look, unfortunately, the cost of America getting this wrong and not seeing what Pat saw was that we allowed the WTO to form and to allow China to become a member of the WTO. We fought the insane Iraq War for nothing, to create a breeding ground for ISIS, a crèche for terrorism. And so, Pat warned us about this. And he was right. The thing was, a lot of people didn’t believe it was going to go the way he said, oh no, China is going to come into the WTO and it’ll be a normal trading partner, it’ll become a democracy, this is going to be wonderful, of course we should do this. Oh, you’re crazy about this American intervention, American might’s going to democratize the rest of the world. So, … guns and butter — I guess, to use the cliché — we’re going to make everybody liberal democracies around the world. Pat was saying that wasn’t going to happen. The great advantage Trump had, really, is that he didn’t have to warn people about what was going to happen. We had seen it. We knew Iraq was a disaster. We saw the American industrial base destroyed by allowing China into the WTO. So, what Pat was doing was, in a way, lighting the signal fire to say, Mordor is coming, beware. And people said, no, we’ve heard this warning before, nothing bad will happen. It was here when Trump came. And so, Americans were awake to the fact that something needed to be done.”

He concluded, “I really do hope that, — frankly, Donald Trump should award Pat Buchanan a Medal of Freedom. Because he was a precursor to so much of what we’re doing today. Look, and I’m not saying, like, — I don’t think Trump was inspired by Pat. Actually, if you look at Pat Buchanan’s — what Pat Buchanan was saying early on, Trump was saying the same things back then. He just wasn’t primarily in politics. But I do think, like, Pat deserves a very public recognition from the American people for what he warned us about. It all came true.”

Bennet, who is expected to announce his campaign as soon as Friday, will look to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in a state that has trended toward his party in recent years. And he is the latest Senate Democrat looking to leave Washington, after three retirement announcements in recent weeks.

Kamala Harris won Colorado by 9 percentage points in November, and Polis won a second term in 2022 by 19 points. Bennet also won a third term that year by 15 points, meaning his term runs until 2028 — but he can run for governor and remain in the Senate.

Bennet will not be alone in the Democratic field, with state Attorney General Phil Weiser also in the race, creating a battle of two statewide officeholders.

Axios was first to report Bennet's move to run for governor. A spokesperson for Bennet declined to comment.

In a statement, Weiser said, ""Two years ago, the voters sent Senator Bennet back to D.C. because we believed he would be there for us no matter what — especially in historically dangerous moments like the one we currently face. Now more than ever, we need experienced Democratic leaders in Washington.""

Republicans could be looking at a potentially crowded primary field, with two state legislators already in the race. But the GOP faces an uphill climb in the state, where Democrats have found success in statewide races.

Bennet, a former Denver school superintendent, has worked as a bipartisan dealmaker, a member of the so-called Gang of Eight that worked on an ill-fated bipartisan immigration measure.

Bennet has also been known to make fiery speeches on the Senate floor and in hearing rooms, recently admonishing CIA Director John Ratcliffe over the news that administration officials discussed military plans in a Signal chat group.

“This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for him is entirely unacceptable. It’s an embarrassment,” Bennet said. “You need to do better. You need to do better.”

And ahead of his presidential bid in 2019, he delivered a passionate speech lambasting Republicans’ “crocodile tears” about the ongoing government shutdown.

Bennet has also bucked his party at times, becoming the first Senate Democrat last year to warn that President Joe Biden could not defeat Donald Trump after Biden’s disastrous debate performance.

He has been telegraphing an exit from Washington — he told Politico in March that the answer to the country’s “central fight” is “as likely to come from the states as it is from Washington” over the next decade. And he said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” days later that he has been considering “where I can fight best for the people of Colorado.”

In his 2019 book, he described the “pathological culture of the Capital” and chronicled his frustrations with things like the collapse of the bipartisan immigration bill in 2013 at the hands of “hyperfactionalism,” the rise of unlimited campaign spending on policy issues and the decision to end the filibuster for judicial nominees.

His unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020 appealed to nostalgia for pre-Trump politics — he repeatedly argued that “if you elect me president, you won’t have to think about me for two weeks at a time.”

And he has argued his party has a lot of work to do to “create a compelling view for Americans that is going to allow us to lead again.”

“The Democratic Party needs to use this moment of having been repudiated at the national level, to figure out a creative and imaginative agenda for the 21st century that’s going to lift the fortunes of working people and the middle class, all across this country,” he said on “Meet the Press.”

So far this year, three Democratic senators have announced their intention to leave Washington at the end of next year — Michigan’s Gary Peters, Minnesota’s Tina Smith and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen. Unlike Bennet’s, their terms expire in 2026.",Lean Left

More than 200 people, including 17 US citizens, died after the roof of the popular Jet Set nightclub collapsed in the Dominican Republic’s capital, Santo Domingo, this week in one of the Caribbean country’s deadliest tragedies.

Footage from the scene early Tuesday morning showed how a celebratory event turned into a disaster. Beloved merengue singer Rubby Pérez is first seen serenading the crowd, accompanied by his orchestra.

Moments later, the club’s disco balls begin to sway before the roof suddenly collapses. Screams and crashing sounds can be heard for several seconds before the video cuts out.

The deadly incident claimed the lives of several prominent Dominicans, including at least two former Major League Baseball players and Pérez, sending shockwaves throughout the country as investigators frantically seek its cause.

Here’s what we know:

The search for survivors ends

The collapse killed at least 231 people, Dominican officials said Monday. At least 17 are US citizens, according to a State Department spokesperson last week.

Dominican Health Minister Víctor Atallah said at least 189 people were injured in the disaster.

“All reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors” had been exhausted,” Dominican emergency authorities said, adding that the focus of their operation is now recovering bodies.

Many who died suffered from traumatic head injuries, according to the health minister.

“Most of the deceased died instantly,” Atallah told local newspaper El Caribe. “Many were sitting; the ceiling fell on their heads and chests.”

Search efforts have also taken a mental toll on rescue workers. “You hear people who are trapped, screaming for help – it’s a bit difficult,” Daniel Heredia, a member of the Dominican Civil Protection Service, told CNN.

At a Thursday press conference, the director of the country’s emergency services wept as he described the scale of the tragedy.

“Today, I conclude the hardest job I’ve ever done in my 20 years of service,” Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Dominican Emergency Operations Center.

For Juan Salas, director of the country’s Civil Defense group, the nightclub was unrecognizable when he arrived on the scene. “What had been a stage of lights, music, and joy took on a different meaning,” Salas told CNN. “It turned gray, lifeless. It became a scene of people screaming on one side, running on the other.”

Family members of victims who spoke to local media outlets described their frustration at the pace of recovery efforts and the pain of being unable to identify their relatives.

“Just as (President Abinader) brought rescuers from Puerto Rico, he should bring more doctors to speed this up,” one woman told Noticias Sin.

Investigation continues

The Jet Set is one of the country’s most high-profile venues, close to the busy El Malecón thoroughfare in the heart of Santo Domingo. Its Monday night events are among its best attended.

Hundreds of people were believed to be in the club when the roof collapsed early Tuesday morning.

Among the survivors is Javier Molleja, who told CNN that he heard a “horrible and immense sound” when the club’s roof caved in. He was with his mother and managed to escape with her. “It was immediate,” Molleja said of the roof collapse. “Everything fell. I mean, absolutely everything.”

The exact cause of the disaster is currently under investigation. On Thursday, the Dominican presidency announced the creation of an investigative commission into the disaster’s exact cause, comprised of “leading experts” from both the Dominican Republic and abroad.

Puerto Rican firefighter Joel Figueroa, whose team is currently assisting Dominican authorities with rescue and recovery operations, speculated that the building may have been unable to carry the weight on its roof.

“We saw concrete slabs in the (nightclub) without rebar, which effects the capability of the building,” said Figueroa, referring to steel bars usually added to concrete to increase its strength under tension.

“It’s amazing how long that roof supported that kind of load. We’re talking about generators, air conditioners. We saw different layers of concrete just on the roof that add more weight. And without rebar, that also affects the building.”

The nightclub was built more than 50 years ago, according to local media reports, and had a capacity to hold up to 500 people.

Aerial footage now shows the venue with a wide, gaping hole in the middle of the building where the audience would have been located during the performance.

Jet Set owner Antonio Espaillat said the club is maintaining “full and transparent” cooperation with authorities responding to the collapse.

“From the very beginning, we have been collaborating fully and transparently with the authorities,” Espaillat said in a statement video posted hours after the accident on the club’s Instagram account.

“We remain in constant communication with (emergency services), as search and rescue efforts continue with emergency teams, volunteers, and personnel from more than 22 institutions.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday, prosecutor Rosalba Ramos said that once the debris is removed at Jet Set “we will begin expert reports in the disaster’s ground zero and contact family members to come to the prosecutor’s office for recovered belongings and other procedures.”

A country mourns

The club often attracts celebrity patrons, and among the dead are numerous notable figures in Dominican culture, sports and politics.

Pérez, the 69-year-old singer who died during his performance, was known as the “Loudest Voice in Merengue.” His daughter Zulinka was also singing with him when the nightclub’s ceiling collapsed.

She told CNN affiliate Univision that her father saved her life. After the collapse, Zulinka said she told Pérez from under the rubble that she couldn’t exert herself because she was recovering from surgery.

Pérez told his daughter, “Okay, stay where your microphone is and I’ll stay where mine is,” Zulinka said.

If he hadn’t consoled her, “I wouldn’t be here,” Zulinka told Univision.

Footage of Pérez’s memorial service at the National Theatre in Santo Domingo on Thursday shows Dominican President Luis Abinader among the mourners. The singer’s trademark hat and sunglasses were placed atop his casket, along with a wreath bearing the message “Always With Us.”

At least two former Major League Baseball players also perished in the disaster. Octavio Dotel, who won the World Series while pitching for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, died en route to the hospital.

Tony Blanco, a former player for the Washington Nationals, was also killed, according to MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred and the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Sports.

Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monte Cristi province, also died at the scene, according to Dominican President Luis Abinader.

Almost immediately after the roof caved in, Cruz called President Abinader to alert him of the tragedy even while she was trapped under the rubble, according to First Lady Raquel Arbaje. “The president started mobilizing all the organizations” to send help right after the call, she said.

“We’re grateful to the Dominican authorities,” one man, Ramón, told CNN. He traveled to the Dominican Republic from New Jersey after his 23-year-old niece was killed in the collapse.

On April 10, Abinader extended what was initially a three-day period of mourning for an additional three days.

Some Democrats expressed opposition to the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act on the House floor Thursday after only four of them voted in support of the legislation.
The SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship to register to vote as opposed to simply affirming that the voter is a United States citizen on a form. 
The list of eligible documents includes a passport, a government-issued photo ID, a birth certificate and other forms of identification. Only one of them would be needed. Opponents have argued the bill would make it more difficult for women who no longer use their maiden name to vote, whereas proponents say it’s a myth.
Rep. Laura Friedman, D-Calif., said it is a ""modern-day poll tax, targeting American women and low-income Americans.""

During the floor debate, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., dismissed that argument.
""Bless my colleagues' hearts on the other side of the aisle, using women as a ‘gotcha’ for voting. I’ve never had to bring my birth certificate to prove that I was a registered voter. I have an ID that has a different name than my birth certificate,"" the Republican said.
""Since we're using women as bait here, maybe in the next round of debates they can explain to us exactly what a woman is."" 
Other Democrats said it posed serious voter suppression questions. 
DEMS FIGHT BILL TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT VOTING DESPITE POLLS SHOWING VOTER SUPPORT

""This bill could force Georgians to pay more than $700 million just to register to vote. Y’all, that’s a poll tax, plain and simple, and it’s blatant voter suppression,"" Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga, said on the floor. ""Voter suppression by any other name is still voter suppression. This bill violates the 14th, 19th and 24th amendments and … every tenant of a free and inclusive democracy. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this disgrace of a voter suppression bill.""
Still, proponents believe it would help further secure elections from any noncitizens voting in elections. But opponents argue it's an unnecessary step given the uncommon nature of noncitizens voting and the additional paperwork burden.  
VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT PHOTO ID REQUIREMENT TO VOTE, NEW POLL SAYS
Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., posted that it’s a ""myth"" that ""married women’s right to vote"" would be restricted.
""The SAVE Act directs states to establish a process for discrepancies, such as a name change, so that individuals can still register to vote,"" Edwards tweeted. ""This bill lists forms of identification that a voter could provide when registering to vote, but that voter only needs to provide one document, including a driver's license or any valid government-issued ID card.""

People who are not American citizens are already not legally permitted to register to vote, which essentially makes the legislation an additional safeguard, according to those in favor of it. 
""It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. This could impact almost 150 million Americans,"" Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., said in a video Thursday, adding it might be tough for people to get the proper identification like a birth certificate or a passport to prove citizenship. ""So the SAVE Act is not solving a problem. It’s creating one.""

President Donald Trump supports the bill, and he recently issued an executive order for similar election reforms. The bill made it through the House last year with Republicans and a few Democrats supporting it, but it did not make it through the Senate and could face similar hurdles this time.
All Republicans who were present for the vote supported the act, along with Democratic representatives Ed Case, Jared Golden, Henry Cuellar and Marie Gluesenkamp-Perez. The bill is led by two Republicans, Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Utah Sen. Mike Lee.

CBS News,Melissa Quinn,Trump suggests using law firms that pledged pro bono services to help U.S. in tariff talks,Four major law firms have entered into agreements with the White House that include providing millions of dollars in pro bono legal services.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-suggests-using-law-firms-that-pledged-pro-bono-services-to-help-u-s-in-tariff-talks/,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/10/dab15453-6b50-404a-9063-5616c5baddb4/thumbnail/1200x630/b28b589e61fa3b487be3850814b87cff/gettyimages-2209421067.jpg?v=653dd6912cdd8596c9bfea812c355f95,2025-04-10T18:08:39Z,Washington — President Trump this week floated the possibility of using the law firms that agreed to provide free legal services through deals reached with the White House to assist the United States… [+4608 chars],"Washington — President Trump this week floated the possibility of using the law firms that agreed to provide free legal services through deals reached with the White House to assist the United States in its trade negotiations over tariffs, potentially with dozens of countries.

During a Cabinet meeting Thursday, the president told reporters that his administration may be using lawyers at the firms to help agency heads because you're going to need a lot of lawyers."" Mr. Trump said he would ""try to use these very prestigious firms to help us out with the trade"" because of the sizable number of countries with which the U.S. will be negotiating.

On Wednesday, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as he signed executive orders, Mr. Trump said that the firms that entered into agreements to avoid being targeted by his directives have together committed at least $340 million in pro bono legal services and suggested that he could tap into that work as his administration prepares to engage in talks over tariffs he has threatened to impose on foreign countries.

""I think part of the way I'll spend some of the money that we're getting from the law firms in terms of their legal time will be — if we can do it, I think we can do it — using these great law firms to represent us with regard to the many, many countries that we'll be dealing with,"" Mr. Trump said.

The president praised the firms as having some of the ""best lawyers in the world,"" but lamented that they ""went off a little bit.""

Mr. Trump made the remarks after signing several executive orders, including one that directed his administration to take action against Susman Godfrey, a New York-based firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The network and Dominion reached a $787 million settlement agreement in the case that arose after Fox News aired unfounded accusations that Dominion helped rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump.

Susman Godfrey is the fifth major law firm that the president has targeted with an executive order since returning to the White House. The orders seek to punish the firms for their legal work or for employing attorneys he views as his political opponents.

Mr. Trump's directive attacks the firm for purportedly spearheading ""efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.""

In response to the order, Susman Godfrey said in a statement, ""Anyone who knows Susman Godfrey knows we believe in the rule of law, and we take seriously our duty to uphold it. This principle guides us now. There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order.""

In addition to Susman Godfrey, the president's executive orders have targeted Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Covington & Burling. For the first four law firms, the directives seek to go after government contracting ties and restrict their access to federal buildings and employees. The order on Covington & Burling involved a security clearance for one of its lawyers.

Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's executive action, and federal judges have blocked the administration from enforcing portions of them.

But another four major law firms have reached deals with the president, in which they committed to provide as much as $100 million each in pro bono legal services to causes supported by the Trump administration. Those firms are: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom; Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP; Milbank LLP; and Paul Weiss.

In announcing the agreements, Mr. Trump said the pro bono work would support initiatives like assisting veterans, members of the military, law enforcement and first responders, as well as ensuring fairness in the justice system and combating antisemitism. None of those announcements mentioned trade or tariffs.

The president's suggestion about using the free legal services for trade negotiations came after he announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs and a lowering of the White House's reciprocal tariff rate to 10% for nearly all countries, including the European Union.

Mr. Trump wrote on social media that more than 75 countries have called U.S. officials seeking to negotiate over the tariffs. The White House did not say which countries have expressed a willingness to engage in talks with the U.S.

Neither the law firms nor the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative immediately returned requests for comment.",Lean Left

The House passed a Republican-led bill Thursday to require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, despite the fact that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections.

The move is a push by House Republicans that aligns with actions President Donald Trump is taking from the White House. Lawmakers voted 220-208 to send the bill to the Senate for consideration. Four Democrats voted with House Republicans in support of the measure.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has touted the legislation, saying that it will safeguard and protect elections. But critics warn that the bill – known as the SAVE Act – threatens to restrict voting access by creating unnecessary hurdles that will make it harder to register to vote and wrongfully disenfranchise legitimate voters.

It is already against the law for people who aren’t US citizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely happens.

Now that the bill has passed the House, it would next need to be taken up by the GOP-led Senate where its fate is unclear. The measure would require support from at least some Democrats to pass the chamber.

House Republicans passed the SAVE Act during the last session of Congress, but it did not advance in the then-Democratic-controlled Senate.

In addition to requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration in federal elections, the bill also includes provisions for removing noncitizens from federal voter registration rolls.

As many as 21 million American citizens who are old enough to vote don’t have easy access to a birth certificate, passport, or other documentation proving their citizenship, according to research from the Brennan Center for Justice and partner organizations, including the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement at the University of Maryland and VoteRiders.

“This is a solution in search of a problem that will unfortunately disenfranchise millions of Americans,” Sean Morales-Doyle, the director of voting rights at the Brennan Center, said of the House bill in an interview.

Democratic groups and non-partisan organizations separately have sued over an executive order targeting election procedures signed by Trump, kicking off a court fight over the president’s attempt to unilaterally revamp how elections are run.

In March, Trump signed an executive order seeking to boost proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration.

This week, the verified account of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement department posted on X and Instagram an infographic about its work. “If it crosses the U.S. border illegally,” they wrote, “it’s our job to STOP IT.” A list followed, and one word very much stood out: “Ideas.”

The agency later replaced the image, substituting in the words “Intellectual Property.”

We wrote the ICE media office on Thursday to learn more: “Do we have a list of these ideas? Are there examples of ideas that ICE has prevented from illegally entering the country? Are there any task forces devoted to preventing these ideas?” We did not hear back, but noticed that the word “ideas” had been removed.

Third-party efforts to track people seized and held by ICE include Inside Higher Ed’s campus-abduction tracker, the newsletter Migrant Insider, and a more comprehensive effort called the United States Disappeared Tracker.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Republicans' effort to advance President Donald Trump's budget bill and Democratic opposition to the SAVE Act. 
EXCLUSIVE – After President Donald Trump made surprising gains in solid-blue New York in 2024, one Republican congresswoman capitalized on the momentum with an aggressive fundraising campaign in the Empire State. Her goal is to flip some districts to red in the upcoming midterms and help her party’s goal of expanding the House majority in 2026.
Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., has already hauled in more than $1 million in donations in the first quarter, with more than $223,000 of that being transferred to the National Republican Congressional Committee’s war chest. She attributes those seven-figures to 5,500 donations from more than 2,400 donors.
Tenney told Fox News Digital that she believes the 2026 election will be a ""referendum"" on Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who created what she described as a ""catastrophic powder keg"" in the state prison system. New York Attorney General Letitia James, she added, ""Is extremely unpopular and has engaged in malicious prosecution and lawfare.
""We'll have the weakest governor that we've had in a long time on the Democratic side facing a Republican,"" Tenney said.

Tenney, the founder of the House Election Integrity Caucus, attributed her gains in 2022 and 2024 to ""aggressive advocacy"" and grassroots efforts geared toward Republicans and Democrat-leaning moderates. 
In addition to sending more Republicans from New York to the House of Representatives, Tenney hopes to challenge the governor’s seat and several statewide offices. She also believes that Republicans have a chance at the New York City mayoral race. 
Hochul’s predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is seen as the top contender for the mayor’s race. He has already reported big campaign dollars and favorable public polling. Meanwhile, current mayor Eric Adams has decided to run in the June primary as an independent. Fellow Democrats have turned on Adams for cooperating with the Trump administration on curtailing illegal immigration. 
Tenney was elected to the state legislature in 2010 when Cuomo began his first term as governor. Within a year, Tenney said, Cuomo ""reversed all the policies that he said he was going to run on,"" and instead implemented policies that she called ""catastrophic.""

""Trump did well in New York in 2024. He got his best numbers, his best turnout that he's had in the two prior races. But I think that the referendum is on Kathy Hochul and the down-ballot Democrats who are still very unhinged, still talking about things that are 80-20 wins for Republicans,"" Tenney said. She said Democrats remain focused on issues proven to flop with voters, such as forcing biological males into women's sports and unchecked illegal immigration. 
Tenney said it's important for Republicans to continue to deliver wins on their side, vowing to use her position on the House Ways and Means Committee to extend Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and ""start our road to prosperity and begin the Golden Age."" Tenney also sits on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which oversees the energy sector – another focal point for Republicans, especially in Tenney's district.

Tenney said ""people are worried about rising energy costs and the policies in New York State put forth by Hochul and the Democrats,"" which are driving up energy costs for seniors. 
""That is a looming, really catastrophic issue that is facing New York,"" Tenney said. ""And the Democrats have compromised our state on that issue, and it's going to prevent us from having prosperity, energy, and energy security as well.""

Tenney believes that the new, post-2024 environment has given Republicans an opportunity in her home state. 
"" I don't want to turn the lights out on New York State. It's my home state. It is the state I love. I love my district and my communities. We want to make New York Great Again,"" she said. ""The only way to do that is to start replacing some of these Democrats with Republicans who are common sense and who care about preserving and protecting New Yorkers and are concerned about the future of New York.""

Tariffs aside, the big story in Washington this week has been the latest stage in the struggle of House and Senate Republicans to get on the same page in moving toward enactment of Donald Trump’s legislative agenda via a monstrously large budget-reconciliation bill. They got stuck in the very first stage of the process necessary to enact Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”: a joint congressional budget resolution laying out a basic outline of spending and revenue measures covering the next ten years. This resolution will authorize the next stage, the reconciliation bill itself.

But now they’re finally unstuck, at least for now, as the House narrowly approved a Senate-passed resolution on Thursday.

To go back a bit: After the House and the Senate passed wildly varying budget resolutions that didn’t even agree on the number of reconciliation bills, Trump intervened to endorse the one-bill approach. The Senate moved first with an exceptionally controversial resolution that (a) pretended nearly $4 trillion in tax cuts would have no impact on budget deficits and (b) went extremely light on required budget cuts to pay for these allegedly minimal revenue losses. Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson then told House Republicans to swallow hard and buy the Senate resolution, while instructing House committees to come up with at least a trillion and a half in domestic spending cuts, with the large and popular Medicaid program being the big target. It was a weird sort of agree-to-disagree arrangement likely based on Trump’s total lack of interest in budget details, other than getting the tax cuts he needs to reward business folk unhappy with his tariff agenda and the wild antics of Elon Musk. So the proposed bill essentially kicked the can down the road on all the tough decisions.

But when push came to shove, Johnson and Trump (who did some personal arm-twisting) could not convince the “fiscal hawks” of the House Freedom Caucus to go along with the Senate resolution and had to call off a vote scheduled for Wednesday night. First thing Thursday morning, Johnson and Senate Republican leader John Thune held a brief presser in which the latter announced he was committed to achieving at least $1.5 trillion in unspecified spending cuts and the former confidently predicted this assurance would be enough to get the House fiscal hawks onboard. He was right, as the Senate budget resolution passed the House without a vote to spare (as expected, every Democrat voted “no”).

Basically, then, Senate Republicans learned this morning that their leader has committed them to what will almost certainly be major Medicaid cuts. No, they probably won’t admit that’s what it means, but the budget math simply doesn’t work any other way. So Republicans will be playing right into the chief Democratic message that Trump’s agenda amounts to slashing Medicaid and other popular benefit programs in order to finance a totally unnecessary tax cut for the rich. It’s also possible that House hard-liners will insist on more concrete Senate commitments to specific cuts, perhaps even to Medicaid cuts by name, even before the reconciliation bill is drafted.

So other than the ancient mistrust that underlies House-Senate communications, what’s going on in this struggle over how specific to get on the ultimate content of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill?” For the House Freedom Caucus types, it’s pretty simple: 2025 is the great gettin’ up morning for a project they and their predecessors have nourished since the 1960s: rolling back key elements of the welfare state, of which the Great Society’s Medicaid program is the largest and most politically vulnerable (in the sense of not being totally bulletproof the way Social Security and Medicare have become). They not only want guaranteed domestic spending cuts; they want their own and their party’s fingerprints all over the weapon that wounds the big government beast. If not now, they wonder, when will it ever happen? Yes, they care about budget deficits and public debt, at least more than Trump does, which is one reason they are driving a hard bargain on a budget resolution that includes a major boost in the national debt limit. But in the end it’s about budget cuts as an end in itself.

There are some Senate Republicans who share these obsessions, and they undoubtedly helped convince Thune to issue his handshake agreement with Johnson on budget cuts. Others really just want the tax-cut pot of gold at the end of the process and will do as little or as much as is necessary to get there. We’ll see in the end if they have the political appetite to vote for a reconciliation bill that satisfies both major Republican factions.",Left

The far left and the far right can seem senseless sometimes. That doesn't mean they're stupid. It means they stopped using their five senses to form rational views about politics. Rational views come from seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting.
In court, reports about these five senses are called ""evidence."" Fact witnesses tell courts what they saw, heard, felt, smelled, or tasted. Judges and juries apply reason to this evidence to find truth.
This came from the Age of Reason. Our founders loved it. They used evidence-based reason to organize America's government. The Frenchman, the Marquis de Montesquieu and the Englishman John Locke taught them that government should be bound by a contract with its people and restrained by checks and balances. This thinking was the result of observation and experience.
Science reigned supreme. John Adams called government a science. Benjamin Franklin was a scientist. Thomas Jefferson was an inventor and studied fossils. They ardently believed that the world should be governed by evidence and reason, not blind belief.
But while the 2oth century democracies worshipped this evidence-based science, including the science of governing, these things are slipping away in the 21st, and we should be worried about it because what's taking its place looks a lot like the European medievalism that the Age of Reason supplanted.
The average medieval life in Europe was dominated by blind faith, not the use of the five senses. The medieval world had replaced sensible, road-building Romans and deep-thinking Greeks with faith and fear. Despite the undoubted achievements of the era, the life of the average European in the period between 500-1500 was controlled by belief in God and faith in a king. They believed passionately in what they thought was ""truth"" but reached it without using their own senses. Instead, they were told what to believe by the Church and the Crown. Truth was shrouded in mystery and magic—the powers of the bones of a saint or the magic of a sword wielded by a king. Incantations. Sayings. Ritual assertion of fealty.
Today, the blind-deaf-and-dumb dogma of our far left and right echoes this long-gone lot that preferred to pray disease away rather than wash their hands. Consider the far-left assertion after George Floyd's murder that the existence of some bad police officers meant that all police officers were bad. It ignored what we could see from most police officers every day, and it led to the ""Defund the Police"" movement that left us all less safe. It was similarly tone deaf for the left to blame the white descendants of abolitionists and starving 20th century immigrants for the effects of American slavery. It left many people believing that Democrats opposed white men in politics, culture, and even the movies. It drove them into the arms of the radical right.
Yet the depredations of the radical right—its blindness to reason—its stubborn assertion of lies as truth—and its insistence that objectively bad ideas are good ones—is the worst of the two dangers. Too many of those who voted for President Donald Trump didn't make good use of their eyes and ears when they considered this man. Instead, their disdain for Democrats led them to blind faith in something called ""MAGA,"" and that was apparently enough.
Now blind faith is the only thing Trump can hope will sustain him. His administration fights facts with it. In the face of direct evidence to the contrary, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth asserted that no war plans were shared on Signal. While she didn't provide it, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters to take on faith that she had proof that one of two legal immigrants recently arrested was a gang member and the other a terrorist supporter. Trump insists that the judges opposing him are ""lunatics"" and that attacking our friends and disemboweling the American stock market, is good for us. Trump officials' screaming and finger pointing is beginning to look like a scene from The Crucible.
Americans should stop taking their politics on faith. ""Show me the proof"" should take the place of ""shout me the denials."" Crowds in the streets seem to be getting that point. May they increase.

The House passed the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act on Thursday, with 208 Democrats voting against the President Donald Trump-backed measure that would crack down on noncitizen voting.
The SAVE Act, which passed 220-208, now heads to the Senate, where it will need the support of some Democrats to meet the 60-vote threshold for advancement. Democrats have rejected the bill, despite polling indicating bipartisan support for voter ID requirements. 
A Gallup Poll released ahead of the 2024 election found that 84% of respondents favor requiring a photo ID to vote, and 83% support requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote for the first time. 
If passed in the Senate and signed into law by Trump, the SAVE Act by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, would require voters to obtain proof of citizenship in person before they register for a federal election, and it would remove noncitizens from voter rolls.

Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., added in opposition to what he called the ""extremist anti-voter SAVE Act.""
The SAVE Act passed a procedural hurdle known as a ""rule vote"" on Wednesday. A simple majority of House lawmakers was needed to pass the ""rule"" to allow for debate and eventual House-wide votes on the legislation.
It was first introduced in July 2024 under former President Joe Biden's administration and failed to pass through the Democratic majority in the Senate. Roy reintroduced the bill in January as it was more likely to pass under a Republican-controlled House, Senate and White House.

""The American people have spoken very clearly that they believe only American citizens should vote in American elections. There's nothing controversial about that,"" Roy said on the House floor ahead of the votes. 
""This legislation is designed to restore that faith, to save our elections, to save election integrity. I'm proud to have worked on this bill with my friend, the chairman, with my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I would note that five of my Democrat colleagues joined us last summer to vote for this bill. Hardly a partisan exercise to say that we should protect the elections of the American people,"" he added. 
The bill made headway during the 2024 presidential election as the Republican National Committee (RNC) led voter integrity efforts in battleground states across the country.

House Republicans have taken a critical step to advance President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and border priorities through Congress, a major win for party leadership after quelling a conservative rebellion over the plan’s price tag.

The Thursday morning vote on the Senate’s budget blueprint – a key initial step in the long budget process – will eventually allow Republicans to muscle the president’s first big legislative measure over a Democratic filibuster. It capped a dramatic week for Speaker Mike Johnson, who was forced to call off plans for a vote just hours earlier after nearly 20 Republicans demanded a guarantee of steep spending cuts.

GOP leaders ultimately convinced them to back the plan for how, punting bigger – and more difficult – fights on spending for the coming weeks. It marked a win for Johnson, who has repeatedly relied on Trump to pass contentious bills that conservatives hate.

The speaker met with the last group of holdouts ahead of the vote Thursday morning, as he sought to avoid an embarrassing defeat from his conference. And Trump applied pressure, promoting his “big, beautiful, bill” on Truth Social and making calls to lawmakers.

The president celebrated the chamber’s move later in the day.

Rep. Ralph Norman told CNN that hearing from Trump, who had been in close contact with Johnson, helped to flip his vote.

“This has evolved over the last 24 hours. You’ve got the speaker, you’ve got the president, you’ve got [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune,” the South Carolina Republican said.

Asked about the president’s promises, Norman said: “He was very encouraging. We’re not gonna have a deficit. We’re gonna have $1.5 [trillion] minimum.”

Ahead of the vote, Johnson and Thune sought to present a united front on how to move forward on Trump’s agenda. The pair delivered a joint statement aimed at assuring House conservatives the Senate would back the steep spending cuts that have been a massive sticking point.

“We are committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people, while also preserving our essential programs,” Johnson said unequivocally.

Thune, meanwhile, said that “our ambition in the Senate is we are aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.”

“The speaker’s talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum. And we’re certainly will do everything we can to be as aggressive as possible to see that we are serious about the matter,” he continued.

A number of Republicans wanted to see Thune agree to spending cuts and Johnson to protecting Medicaid despite those cuts. The question remained even minutes ahead of the vote whether the leaders’ commitments had been enough.

In a tense floor conversation, the speaker offered assurances to a group of centrist Republicans that the GOP would protect Medicaid in its future legislative agenda, according to a person familiar with the discussion.

Prior to the vote, Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise huddled with a group of about 10 conservative holdouts in a room just off the House floor, hoping to get final assurances they had convinced them to support the blueprint.

Following the talks, Johnson remained optimistic that he had broken through the logjam after around-the-clock negotiations Wednesday. “We got the votes,” he emphatically told reporters as he left the meeting to head to the floor.

After the vote, Johnson and other House GOP leaders celebrated their chamber’s adoption of the budget blueprint, but acknowledged that there is a tough road ahead as Republicans look to pass a sweeping legislative package.

“That was a big step, because that will allow us now to move forward to have our committees actually drafting the one big, beautiful bill,” Johnson said. “There’s a lot of work ahead of us, and we’re really excited about that.”

“Every step of this process is going to be tough. We’ve said this from the very beginning,” Scalise added, telling reporters that “failure is not an option.”

The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana — joining all Democrats to vote against it.

About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.

""Our two chambers are directly aligned,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. ""We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is ""aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.""

""The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,"" Thune said.

The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.

Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.

The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.

The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.

The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as ""current policy baseline,"" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.

Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a ""collaborative fashion"" over the two-week recess to find savings.

Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.

""We just don't trust the Senate,"" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. ""We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.""

Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution.

Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making ""significant cuts,"" Johnson's ""firm commitment"" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's ""strong statement"" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.

Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his ""no"" vote, called it ""a framework for financial collapse.""

""I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,"" he said.

Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, ""close your eyes and get there."" He added that individual lawmakers may not get ""every little ounce"" of what they want in the legislation.

""It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,"" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.

Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.

""The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. ""It's a disgrace.""

Good morning,
I knew I shouldn't have broken ground on that iPhone factory in my backyard last weekend.
We talked on Monday about the big question of the week being who blinks first in the tariff turmoil, the White House or Wall Street. Yesterday around 1:30 p.m. ET we got our answer.
There's a couple ways to read the big presidential pivot, in which Trump authorized a 90-day pause on all the ""reciprocal"" tariffs but kept the universal 10% tariff in place and ratcheted up the China tariff to 125%.
The first read is that this was Trump's plan all along: shock the system, get all these countries to come to the table to make their own trade deals with the U.S. The big chart, the math that didn't make sense, the tariffs on penguins, the antagonizing of our trading partners...it was all necessary to ""flush out"" China and expose Beijing for being the manipulators of the global economy that they are. The Art of the Deal, baby. This is the message that was broadcast by Treasury Sec. Bessent at an impromptu presser outside the Oval yesterday after Trump's reversal sent stocks through the roof.
Back on Earth, what actually happened was that Trump got spooked. Don't take it from me or the reporting from the NYT, WSJ and even Fox...he said so himself! A couple hours after Bessent came out and spun up this big story about how this was always the plan, the president is the ultimate negotiator, yada yada, the POTUS himself—while hanging out with a bunch of race car drivers on the South Lawn—told reporters he was paying attention to the moves in the bond market (what we talked about yesterday, with yields going higher when they should have been going lower) and saw Jamie Dimon speaking on Fox Business about how ""something had to be done,"" so he decided to institute the big, beautiful pause.
This is honestly the best thing about Donald Trump. In some ways, he's a big liar. In others, he is painfully honest. Either way, he's not an ideologue. He did something, the markets reacted poorly to it, so he pivoted. And this is what I believe is really behind the huge surge in stocks we saw yesterday. Think about it: Trump actually added more uncertainty to the mix by punting the reciprocal tariffs until July. The announcement barely changed the effective tariff rate, since it raised the tariffs so high on China even while lowering them elsewhere (per Bloomberg, the effective rate went from 27% in the morning to 24% in the afternoon, not exactly a huge deescalation). What you were actually seeing, with the Nasdaq up 12% (!) on the day, was investors exhaling: Hey, this guy can still be reasoned with after all. He hasn't just gone nuts, he will actually respond to external pressures, just like during the first term. If Dimon talks to him through the TV, he'll listen.
Only Donald J. Trump could engineer one of the biggest Wall Street relief rallies in history by essentially blockading the world's second-largest economy!
But we're not out of the woods yet. The China tariffs are a huge deal, and the WH is clearly serious now that this is all about isolating Beijing. This creates a whole new can of worms, which I think is why futures are down again this morning. Who wins in a battle of wits between Trump and Xi Jinping, two proud and not easily shaken professional negotiators? The U.S. holds the upper hand from a straight economic perspective. The bet I think Trump and his inner circle are making is that China is weaker than it looks and Xi will have to find a way to open up talks to make some kind of grand bargain on trade, because it cannot win in a world where the US is telling every other country, ""hey, you're either with us or with them."" But can you even make a deal with China at this point? This will be interesting to watch play out, at the very least.
Meanwhile, if you listened when Trump tweeted ""NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!"" a couple hours before his pause, you could've made a buck. And some people definitely made some real money yesterday. Without getting too in the weeds, options trades were off the charts in the 10 minutes before the pause was announced—suggesting there may have been people who knew this was coming, and profited handsomely off it. Will we ever know if those folks happen to work in the White House or Congress? Maybe one day.
President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about his trade war with China escalating beyond the exchange of eye-watering tariffs, alluding to a cache of ""the most powerful weapons in the world."" Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he was ""not concerned"" about the economic conflict with China escalating further. Here's why.

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Taiwanese President William Lai is struggling to contain both open hostility and private ""wooing"" by China. In late March, four Taiwanese soldiers, three of whom were part of a unit that provides security for Taiwan’s Presidential Office, were jailed for up to seven years after being convicted of selling pictures of sensitive information to China. 
The verdicts came after last month’s speech in which Lai condemned the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the harshest terms used by a Taiwanese leader in modern history. In his remarks, the president said Taiwan will not be ""bullied or manipulated"" and promised repercussions against those who make ""expressions of loyalty to the enemy.""
Lai, aware of Beijing’s ""carrot and stick"" campaign, warned Taiwanese to be wary of China’s ""United Front,"" a political strategy employed by the CCP in which they – with plenty of smiles and often ""investment"" capital – enter international organizations and various influential groups and plant agents who then build alliances with targeted individuals, political parties and other interests.
TRUMP CABINET PICKS DELIGHT TAIWAN, SEND STRONG SIGNAL TO CHINA

But Taiwan’s government is swimming upstream against a very strong flow of Chinese covert actions backed by huge sums of Chinese money. Last week, Presidential Office consultant Wu Shang-yu, along with two others from the president’s ruling party, were reportedly detained on suspicion of spying for the CCP.   
For many Taiwanese, Lai’s enough-is-enough speech and subsequent actions by his government are a welcome change from a period of perceived vulnerability. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insiders told Fox News Digital that they feel ""Taiwan has been on the defensive for far too long"" and that their voters ""are tired of us being a punching bag."" 
The DPP government is also promising to take a harder stance against what it calls Chinese infiltration. Taiwanese citizens found to have Chinese identity cards have had their Taiwan nationality revoked because it is illegal to be a Taiwan/China dual citizen or dual ID holder.

China does not accept Taiwanese passports, so those here who wish to travel there must obtain a substitute passport known as ""Taiwan Compatriot ID,"" but these are for temporary stays. Some Taiwanese have sought a Chinese ID card to make living and working in China easier, but the days of divided loyalties are over, according to Taiwan’s government. 
In the days and weeks after Lai’s address, Taiwan’s National Immigration Agency revoked the visas of a handful of Chinese citizens for making online content that contravenes local laws.

Taiwan has some of the most liberal free-speech laws in Asia; here one can stand near government buildings, wave China’s national flag and advocate for communism without fear of arrest. But calling for the ""violent overthrow of Taiwan’s government by the military of the People’s Republic of China"" is a red line, which internet influencer ""Yaya in Taiwan"" crossed, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior. ""Yaya,"" a Chinese national whose real name is Liu Zhenya, lived in Taiwan on a spousal visa and has three children with her Taiwanese husband.
But instead of treating her visa as a privilege, says Taiwan’s government, ""Yaya"" openly supported the forceful annexation of Taiwan by China. Yaya’s defenders argue that she, and others recently evicted from Taiwan, are being selectively prosecuted.
Yet some here are not buying Lai's threats. Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor in the Department of Diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that all this ""get tough with China"" talk is mostly political theater: ""These dramatic Lai administration policy proposals are firstly maneuvers aimed at regaining control over Taiwan’s parliament, as well as building momentum for upcoming local elections in late 2026.""
Huang also said Taiwan’s ruling party, the DPP, is ""crying out to get the Trump administration’s attention in the hope that Trump’s officials will be more willing to endorse the DPP in power and work with, or include, the Lai administration in any ‘countering China’ policy.""

Taipei-based political risk analyst and lawyer Ross Darrell Feingold said Lai’s moves correspond with the tough-on-China approach of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other China hard-liners in the Trump administration: ""The Trump administration will want to see a government in Taiwan that is equally tough on China as the United States, whether in the political, trade or military spheres.""
A broad majority of Taiwanese appear to want tougher measures against acts that threaten Taiwan’s national sovereignty, but some analysts note the new tough talk has arrived just in time for Lai’s party as it hopes to succeed in an ongoing effort to remove opposition Chinese Nationalist Party legislators from office, win control of municipal governments in local elections in November 2026 and then help Lai secure a second term in 2028.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard now oversees the document and controls who receives it.

Officials cite preventing leaks as motivation, reflecting Trump's deep mistrust of the intelligence community.

The general trend across several decades has been to widen dissemination, but there has been an ebb and flow from president to president.

Former officials warn limited distribution could lead to inconsistent foreign policy approaches among administration members.

CNN —

The Trump administration has tightly restricted the number of people who have access to President Donald Trump’s highly classified daily intelligence report, five sources familiar with the move told CNN.

Administration officials planned from the earliest days of Trump’s second term to cut access to the so-called President’s Daily Brief, or PDB — in part because during his first term, details from the report were sometimes leaked to the press, which contributed to the president’s sense that the intelligence community was trying to undermine him.

Initially, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles was personally approving who had access, one of the sources said. Now Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in as Trump’s director of national intelligence in February, oversees the document and has taken responsibility for who has access.

It’s not unusual for new administrations to rejigger who has access to the PDB. And career intelligence officials responsible for putting it together typically approach a new administration to ask who should receive it and officials often move at first to limit access.

But Trump, since he was first elected in 2016, has harbored a deep mistrust of the intelligence community, and in his second administration he has appointed officials who openly share his suspicions. Current and former officials say the move to limit access to the PDB comes against the backdrop of the president and his top officials’ determination to quash leaks and bring to heel what they see as subversive elements within the intelligence community — highlighting what one US official described as “ongoing large distrust issues.”

That distrust — which reached its full expression in Trump’s sense that the FBI’s investigation into his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia was a politically-motivated “witch hunt” and a “hoax” — continues to reverberate in the administration’s muscular approach to managing the intelligence community.

Gabbard in particular has vowed publicly to “aggressively [pursue] recent leakers” and “clean house.” She told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing that she “will welcome dissenting voices to be able to make sure that [the PDB] is thoroughly vetted prior to presenting it and make sure that the truth is reported whether that truth is convenient or not.”

“During DNI Gabbard’s confirmation process, there was bipartisan consensus that the PDB was in need of serious reform,” a spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “The Director is committed to updating numerous outdated processes to ensure President Trump has the most timely and accurate information to protect the American people.”

Former officials say shrinking access to the PDB is an equivocal move that might serve as a confidence-builder between the president and the community — but could also intensify divisions within the government and lead to a disorganized foreign policy, former officials familiar with the process said.

“There’s a risk if you limit it too much you’re not operating off the same page and you have disagreement in the administration on key issues,” one former intelligence official said. Hypothetically, “you don’t have (Secretary of State Marco) Rubio doing the same thing (special envoy to the Middle East Steve) Witkoff is doing.”

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle responded to CNN’s request for comment.

“The President is constantly apprised to classified briefings and is regularly in touch with his national security team. Director Gabbard is restoring the American people’s trust in the Intelligence Community and ending weaponization of government against Americans. The safety and security of the American people is a top priority of President Trump’s,” Ingle said.

‘Way too many’ were getting the PDB

The PDB, which has existed in some form or another since the Kennedy administration, has been presented in different formats under different presidents, but it is widely regarded as one of the most important documents the US government produces, containing some of the most sensitive and up-to-date analysis it has.

The general trend across several decades has been to widen dissemination, but there has been an ebb and flow from president to president. Richard Nixon, for example, had a very, very small dissemination list, at one point restricting his own defense secretary from accessing it, according to one former intelligence official.

Some former officials insist that “way too many people” were getting the PDB under Presidents Biden and Obama, with one saying, “There are slimmed-down versions that are appropriate for most, but very few need what POTUS gets.”

At least one proposal for overhauling the PDB that was circulated among senior Trump officials during the president’s first days in office called for restricting access to the PDB to only a handful of very senior officials and limiting it to roughly 10 articles per day, one of the sources said.

One of the sources said some agencies have been able to renegotiate access.

There’s a cachet to receiving it, several former officials said — no one likes to be left out, even if they don’t have a strict “need to know” reason to receive the document.

“Everybody wants to be a cool kid and get all the good stuff, to get what the president gets just so they can be part of the club,” the former official said.

Just because senior officials don’t receive the PDB doesn’t mean they don’t receive the intelligence it contains in some form or another.

But if access to the PDB becomes too restricted, this person and another former intelligence official said, the White House risks a messy scenario in which senior officials are getting slightly different analytical interpretations of US intelligence.

They won’t be working from the operating picture and might respond inconsistently to foreign policy developments.

That could put the United States at a disadvantage in sensitive negotiations, for example — a path Trump is currently pursuing with multiple US adversaries.

Already, different Trump administration officials responsible for US foreign policy seem to be offering subtly different views of the administration’s approach in public, in particular on tariffs, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett have articulated the strategy differently than White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

Access to the PDB is should be weighed: Shrinking it can give the president confidence that the intelligence analysis will be kept private and, ideally, allow him to consider the honest views of analysts without worrying about the politics of whatever the issue is.

But it can also keep key people responsible for carrying out his policies in the dark about the United States’ best assessments of its adversaries and the risks they pose to the country.

“I don’t think in the theoretical it’s bad, because it will give more freedom to the intelligence community because there will be less pressure to hold things back — they’re going to be more able to tell POTUS if he’s not worried Tom, Dick and Harry are reading it and it might leak,” the former official said.

But the PDB “level-sets for the entire national security team, so it’s really important that everybody has a basic sense of what’s going on,” that person said.

Longstanding distrust

The distrust between Trump and the sprawling intelligence community he now commands has simmered unabated since he was president-elect in 2017, and top Obama administration officials first briefed him on the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia had sought to intervene in the 2016 election on his behalf.

The lesson Trump appeared to take away from his first administration — in which leaks, including of classified information, were rampant — was that the intelligence community was trying to weaponize its data and its analysis to undermine his administration.

Trump’s senior advisers attempted to similarly address issues with the PDB during his first term with a restricted briefing session called the Oval Office Intelligence briefing, that person said.

Before the 2024 election, Trump refused to accept intelligence briefings traditionally offered to the major party candidates — in part because of leaks of PDB material during his first administration, one of the sources said.

In his second term, he has moved aggressively to limit access to information about intelligence and policy deliberations to a small group of officials that the White House has deemed sufficiently loyal to the MAGA cause.

That dynamic is particularly acute at the CIA, according to current and former US officials. There, the White House recently intervened to oust a longtime career official who had been slated to lead the agency’s operational branch, according to current and former officials — an unusual move, because that post is usually determined by the agency itself.

“Things are very tightly held with innermost circle,” the US official said.

A few minutes after taking the stage, a featured speaker at a conference poses a question to the audience: Does anyone here have more than seven kids?

In many circles, asking this would be strange or surprising. But at this kickoff dinner, it’s a clear crowd-pleaser.

Over the din of clinking cutlery, someone shouts out, “Nine!”

“Can anyone beat nine?” the speaker says with an auctioneer’s flair. “Alright, nine has it. Congratulations!”

As the crowd responds with cheers and applause, the audience member with the winning answer adds that their 10th child is on the way.

Welcome to the Natal Conference, NatalCon for short, where a big item on the agenda is boosting birth rates.

Some 200 of the most fervent supporters of a budding movement are here, hoping this in-person meetup will help their cause find an even larger audience — before it’s too late.

Many in this group are unlikely allies who share a common goal. Birth rates, they say, are plummeting to dangerously low levels, posing risks to the economy, services like Social Security and even the future of civilization itself.

And as they see it, getting more people to have more babies is the only solution.

Pronatalists are having a moment, buoyed by Elon Musk’s frequent social media posts amplifying their message and early policy moves under the new Trump administration, such as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s memo promising more funding to places with higher birth rates.

The momentum isn’t lost on organizers of this conference, who say the two-day event drew twice as many attendees this year as their first meeting in 2023, despite a steep $1,000 price tag for admission.

Organizer Kevin Dolan says pronatalists’ overall goals should be an easy sell. But in some circles, they aren’t.

“There’s a civilizational catastrophe coming,” he tells attendees this year, “and the way to solve it is to have sex? Like, that’s got to be the easiest pitch in history. So why do we have people practically clawing their eyes out they’re so furious that people are advocating for this?”

From matchmaking to Man’s World magazine

In many ways, NatalCon is a typical conference scene: The nametags. The pasta salads. And a seemingly endless stream of PowerPoint presentations.

But in some ways, this gathering is notably different from others you might expect to see in the halls of a convention center. A childcare option was offered along with admission. Kids roam the halls at mealtime. Singles looking to find a like-minded match are wearing yellow wristbands. Attendees are leafing through copies of Man’s World magazine in the hallway.

The mix of speakers includes professors, alt-right provocateurs and internet personalities. And on the first day, an angry handful of protesters are outside, accusing attendees of racism and promoting eugenics.

“I love that there’s kids here at the hate conference,” far-right activist Jack Posobiec quips in his opening-night remarks. “You know, this massive ‘hate group’ that we’ve all put together, and yet, in fact, it’s actually just a bunch of like, moms and dads and families.”

It isn’t long before Posobiec’s speech takes on a more dire tone. He points out that birth rates in the US, Australia and Europe are declining.

“If we don’t reverse the tide,” he says, “there are challenges, and there are dark clouds on the horizon. Everything that we have worked for and built, the cathedrals would crumble, the Constitution would fade, the West would become a memory, a footnote in someone else’s story.”

This is the war for civilization, and we are going to win it, one life at a time. Jack Posobiec in a speech at the Natal Conference

Pronatalism, he tells the crowd, is the last line of defense in a battle for the West’s survival.

“The stakes are nothing less than everything. This is the war for civilization,” he says, “and we are going to win it, one life at a time.”

A movement gets ‘Elon-ified’

It’s been nearly a year since Musk shared organizer Kevin Dolan’s speech from the last NatalCon with his millions of followers on X, his social media platform. Dolan, a Mormon with six children and a seventh on the way, says that “undisputably” brought more attention to the issues he’s trying to spotlight.

Demographer Lyman Stone, who’s one of the speakers at this year’s conference and director of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies in Charlottesville, Virginia, says Musk’s influence in the conversation is clear. He points to a chart measuring online searches for pronatalism-related terms over time. There’s a point in 2023 when interest spikes. “It gets Elon-ified,” Stone says.

“You have one of the world’s most powerful and influential men, controlling one of the world’s central disseminating points for ideas and information, really promoting the idea that low fertility is a major social problem. And I agree with him. It is,” Stone says.

Elon Musk reaches out to his son, Æ A-Xii, outside the White House on March 11 as President Donald Trump stands nearby. ""The topic of demographic decline clearly matters to Elon Musk, JD Vance, and many others in the Trump administration, which means that the great ideas developed here can get a hearing that would not have been possible last year,"" Natal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan said at the recent Texas event.

Women are having fewer children than they want, Stone argues. And if something doesn’t change, he says, that will lead to numerous social and economic problems down the line.

“People aren’t getting the life they want…but also, there are material consequences of falling fertility,” he says.

Stone says he doesn’t always agree with Musk’s views. But the billionaire’s frequent posts on the issue, he says, have brought far more attention to it.

“He’s made it much harder to ignore,” Stone says.

Some pronatalists bristle at Musk’s approach to the issue in his personal life; the billionaire has publicly acknowledged fathering at least 13 children with multiple women. But they appreciate his devotion to their cause.

The day this year’s NatalCon began, Musk gave an interview to Fox News. He didn’t mention the event, but when asked to share the biggest worry keeping him up at night, the billionaire pointed to falling birth rates.

“Nothing seems to be turning that around,” he said. “Humanity is dying.”

Why critics accuse pronatalists of fearmongering

Many scholars who study population growth say pronatalists’ concerns about a looming civilization collapse are overblown.

In the US and around the world, families are far smaller now than they were decades ago. And in many countries – including the US – birth rates have dipped below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, which is the rate countries need to maintain stable population numbers, without accounting for migration. Experts estimate that by the end of this century, the population of almost all countries in the world will be declining rather than growing.

But that doesn’t mean we’re on the verge of a catastrophe, according to Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Maryland.

Even as birth rates decline, he says, global population growth is projected to continue for the next 50 years. And even after the world’s population peaks, the sizeable drop predicted would occur over hundreds of years, he says.

“What will happen is over the next couple of hundred years, the world population will fall down to where we were about 30 years ago… No one ever thought six billion people was too few. I’m not worried about that,” he says. “We’ve got environmental reasons to think that’s good. We’ve got economic reasons to be concerned about what that process looks like. But we’ve got a lot of problems, and that’s pretty far down the list.”

No policy can increase the number of babies born yesterday. Philip N. Cohen in an op-ed criticizing pronatalism

In the short term, he says, there’s another way to shore up working populations as societies age: immigration. In fact, Cohen says that’s the only option, because the population will age more quickly than any babies born today can become workers.

“No policy can increase the number of babies born yesterday,” Cohen wrote in an op-ed last year criticizing pronatalism.

Notes are seen at the Natal Conference, where some 200 people gathered to brainstorm solutions to help solve the problem of falling birth rates. CNN

Karen Guzzo, a professor of sociology and director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says she sees herself as an anti-pronatalist.

“I don’t think we should try to make people have kids. I don’t think we should try to make people get married. I think there are small nudges we could do that might raise the birth rate — you know, if we had a better safety net, if we had paid leave and paid childcare, but also economic mobility, things that make people feel certain about their future,” she says.

Around the world, she says, efforts to push pronatalist policies to boost birth rates have faltered.

“It just doesn’t actually work. There have been all sorts of efforts. Some of the East Asian countries have things in place that we Americans would die to have — like these long, extended leaves, access to fertility treatments…childcare availability,” she says. “But they haven’t changed the work culture, and they haven’t changed men’s roles, and so it’s not enough.”

‘People are afraid of being mischaracterized’

Skeptics of pronatalism are difficult to spot inside this closed-door conference, where a handful of security and staff are screening attendees. But a small group of protesters is chanting outside on day one, accusing attendees of racist and Nazi sympathies.

“Behind a thin veil of pseudoscience and intellectualism, this event gave a platform to fascists, race scientists, and far-right ideologues who openly promote population control, racial hierarchies, and authoritarian rule,” Arshia Papari, a spokesperson for the Austin chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, which organized the protest,﻿ told CNN in an email.

Some at the conference joke about the small protest turnout. Others seem on edge and are hesitant to speak with media covering the event. One man tells CNN he followed friends in the tech industry to this event “by accident” and fears he could lose his job for attending.

Ahead of the conference, press coverage called out some speakers as “race science promoters and eugenicists,” and students accused the event of hosting Nazis.

Dolan says he sees those labels as “white noise.”

“I’ve heard those words used to describe people who I just I know to be incredibly empathic, people who love everybody, people who want everybody to succeed, people who have no correlation whatsoever to any of the movements that are being described by those words ostensibly,” he says. “And so yeah, you just can’t be governed by people calling you names.”

Natal Conference event organizer Kevin Dolan speaks during an interview. CNN

Still, he says it’s no surprise some at the conference are camera-shy.

“People are afraid of being mischaracterized. … Even I have this trepidation about this thing that I’ve poured my heart into being sort of raked over the coals and mischaracterized and used as ammunition in this fight that I think is kind of fundamentally wrong-headed,” Dolan says.

Why pronatalists hope a ‘big tent’ will help their cause

Dolan and others attending the conference say it’s common for people here to agree on big-picture problems. But there are plenty of ways they don’t see eye to eye. And that’s part of the point.

“You’re going to hear ideas that you disagree with. You’re going to hear ideas I disagree with. And I don’t think that it is appropriate to rule people out when they are coming in good faith to address a problem of this magnitude,” he says.

Dramatically disparate groups are finding space in the pronatalist scene, according to Catherine R. Pakaluk, an associate professor of political economic thought at the Catholic University of America who’s authored a book exploring why certain women choose to have large families.

“It’s pretty difficult to draw a neat, tidy circle around everybody here,” she says. There are those on the extreme right, she says, and those who favor more immigration. There are tech bros who favor science like artificial wombs and in-vitro fertilization. And then there are “Trad Catholics and Mormons,” she says, “people who really believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman, and the children that they have together.”

Many attendees at this year's Natal Conference were men. At least six women who'd been scheduled to speak at the event dropped out because they were pregnant, according to featured speaker Simone Collins. ""Their family comes first, and that’s what pronatalism is all about,"" Collins says. CNN

For her part, Pakaluk says she doesn’t agree with many of the views others at the conference espouse but wanted to come and present her research.

“One of the things that often gets skipped over in any discussion of natalism today is kind of the actual lives of women who make decisions about whether or not to bring a child into the world,” she says.

Dan Hess, a writer and father of six who regularly posts his analyses of declining birth rates under the X handle @MoreBirths, says diverse viewpoints are necessary to solve what he sees as a problem of epic proportions.

“It does not get solved without a big tent,” he says. As word spreads, Hess says he hopes more liberals will join the largely conservative conversation.

Writer and public policy consultant Paul Constance says that’s why he’s at NatalCon.

“The politics of most of the people who are here are abhorrent to me,” he says. “But that’s not the reason I’m here. I think it’s a really big, big topic, and progressives need to be in the conversation.”

‘This movement isn’t about shaming people into having kids’

Simone Collins weaves through the halls with a bonnet on her head and a baby strapped on her back.

She and her husband, Malcolm, have fashioned themselves into the public face of pronatalism. They head a foundation dedicated to the cause. And many attendees at the conference say they heard about it from the couple’s podcast.

The bonnet is attention-grabbing — an ironic clapback at critics who invoke the oppression of bonnet-wearing characters in “The Handmaid’s Tale” when they hear pronatalists’ points.

“Two things can be true at the same time. Malcolm originally convinced me to get a bonnet to troll people, and then I realized — wait, a hair covering is really useful when you’re doing really messy housework and when there’s all these other factors. So I wear it both to troll, and because it’s useful,” Simone says.

Simone and Malcolm Collins speak during an interview at the Natal Conference in Austin, Texas. CNN

But unlike the dystopian fiction they hope her attire will invoke, the Collinses stress that, in reality they don’t want to force anyone to have kids who doesn’t want to.

“This movement isn’t about shaming people into having kids or convincing people with no kids to have one or two,” Simone says. “It’s about making it easier for families to have the family size they want, because people are not making that number anymore.”

If more isn’t done, she says, the world’s diversity will suffer.

“What we’re heading toward, clearly, based on many localized birth rates, is a mass extinction event of cultural and ethnic and societal diversity,” Simone says. “That is really scary. I want a future in which there are thousands of different subgroups, not three.”

What we’re heading toward, clearly, based on many localized birth rates, is a mass extinction event of cultural and ethnic and societal diversity. That is really scary. I want a future in which there are thousands of different subgroups, not three. Simone Collins

If such dire predictions are true, why, then, are so many scholars pushing back against pronatalists’ concerns?

Malcolm Collins claims many demographers are simply lying about the severity of the situation because it doesn’t square with their beliefs.

He also argues it’s “intensely unethical” to rely on immigration to solve the problem.

“As a wealthy country, yeah, we can continue to drain these other countries and dry up their talent pools. … but we are astronomically screwing these countries over,” he says.

The Collinses have four children and a fifth on the way. Because of health issues, the couple says they’ve used in vitro fertilization to grow their family. They openly discuss testing and selecting embryos for health and personality traits — and they’re often accused of using pronatalism as code for eugenics.

Simone Collins says that’s an inaccurate comparison.

“This is just people choosing among their own embryos. We’re not talking about sterilizing people or all the classic problems that are out there with eugenics,” she says.

A teen looking for love at the conference encounters a wrinkle

Benjamin Detry, 19, doesn’t have any kids yet. But he tells CNN he’s hoping to have at least five eventually, and here at the conference, he’s looking for a partner.

Detry is one of numerous attendees wearing the yellow wristbands organizers hope will help singles pair up. He says he drove to Austin from Houston, where he’s a college student, and spent his savings to attend the conference. But now that he’s here, he’s not sure about his prospects.

“There’s a lot of lads here. There’s not that many ladies,” he says. “So I wonder how the matchmaking event is going to turn out. Maybe it’s going to be kind of like a Coliseum battle, you know, like where the winner takes all.”

At the conference, single attendees interested in meeting like-minded people were given yellow wristbands. CNN

Simone Collins tells us there’s a good reason fewer women are at the conference than expected. At least six speakers dropped out of the event, she says, because they were pregnant.

“People are putting their money where their mouth is. Their family comes first,” she says, “and that’s what pronatalism is all about.”

There’s no Coliseum battle on NatalCon’s agenda. But in addition to the wristbands, the conference is offering sessions on dating, courtship and matchmaking – some led by Simone.

Organizers say they’re hoping to help foster real-life connections that are hard to find in today’s app-driven dating landscape.

Constance, the policy consultant, says his 29-year-old daughter had joined other liberal family members in mocking him over his participation in NatalCon. But she had a surprising reaction when she learned about the conference’s matchmaking side.

“She said, ‘If you find any viable candidates, here’s a photo you can share.’ That’s how bad the dating scene is,” Constance says.

That’s one area, at least, where pronatalists and critics of this movement may agree.

One of Donald Trump’s most noteworthy characteristics as a president has been his robust deployment of the so-called madman theory in foreign policy. First developed during the Nixon administration, the idea is to convince potential adversaries that the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger has zero compunctions about pressing it — or about taking other dangerous steps that rational actors would never seriously consider. The possibility that the most powerful military in the history of the world may be in the hands of a homicidal maniac gave said maniac enormous leverage in situations involving international conflict. And the ever-constant threat of incredibly lethal violence fit in perfectly with Trump’s own personality and his Jacksonian approach to national defense, in which Uncle Sam would mostly mind his own business but was prepared to wreak holy hell on anyone who looked funny at him.

The madman theory is thus an important component of a message to a dangerous world that is basically “Fuck around and find out.”

But in Trump 2.0, it is increasingly apparent that the same psychology of erratic and often terrifying brinkmanship has been extended into nearly every policy arena, domestic as well as international, which isn’t surprising insofar as Trump’s universe of perceived “enemies” now tilts heavily toward people living in this country.

The blend of chaos, malice, and terror associated with pursuit of the madman theory in foreign policy has been abundantly present in the unprecedented assault on the federal government by Elon Musk’s DOGE and Russell Vought’s Office of Management and Budget. Both of these presidential operatives strongly believe the deep state is a nest of evil civilization-devouring elitists who must be crushed remorselessly. In his own companies, Musk has invariably exemplified the move-fast-and-break-things ethic of Silicon Valley, wherein running up video-game numbers of jobs lost and lives ruined is inherently virtuous. And Vought has been even more candid about his determination to demoralize public employees, as ProPublica reported last fall after viewing a speech in which the once and future director of the “nerve center of the federal government” explained his second-term plans:

[A major] priority, according to Vought, was to “defund” certain independent federal agencies and demonize career civil servants, which include scientists and subject matter experts. Project 2025’s plan to revive Schedule F, an attempt to make it easier to fire a large swath of government workers who currently have civil service protections, aligns with Vought’s vision.

“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” he said. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.

“We want to put them in trauma.”

So the confusion and sheer panic associated with DOGE orders and OMB-directed funding and personnel moves have been very deliberate. If the chaotic manner in which these incoherent plans were carried out made it hard for federal employees to get work done, that was all the better, since this administration does not value such work. From within the bureaucracy, it very much felt as if the federal government were in the hands of madmen, who treated them like they were North Koreans.

But the most remarkable deployment of the madman theory of this administration so far has probably been the ongoing saga of trade policy, with vast implications for both international and domestic affairs. Before and certainly after “Liberation Day” — when Trump announced a regime of near-universal tariffs, chaos, and constant changes of direction — ever-escalating expressions of belligerence have characterized trade policy to an extent never seen before.

Books will undoubtedly be written about the backstory of Liberation Day, and we may eventually find out the extent to which the wild disorder of Trump’s announcements reflected a behind-the-scenes power struggle between protectionist ideologues and more conventional conservatives horrified by the likely fallout of a trade war. At various points, it has appeared that Trump himself was being whipsawed by the disastrous impact on financial markets of his threats to build a sort of Fortress America with strategies straight out of the 19th century.

But in the wake of Trump’s latest wild move — a sudden 90-day pause on the tariffs he just imposed last week combined with new high tariffs for China — it’s notable that his flacks are once again deploying the madman theory to suggest the Boss is shrewdly manipulating us all in order to further a deeply shrewd policy agenda. As relieved investors reacted positively to the news that Trump had done yet another 180-degree turn, administration spokesmen and allies claimed it was all part of the plan:

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt: Many of you in the media clearly missed the Art of the Deal — Jeff Stein (@JStein_WaPo) April 9, 2025

This was brilliantly executed by @realDonaldTrump. Textbook, Art of the Deal. — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 9, 2025

Trump, of course, has actually not accomplished a thing yet in terms of securing major concessions from trading partners. His pause on Liberation Day tariff rates amounted to the partial refilling of a hole he very deliberately dug. But leave it to his fans to believe that he’s playing ten-dimensional chess while his critics and adversaries are playing checkers. The more chaos Trump generates, the greater the genius it proves, since no normal mind could possibly come up with such an erratic course of action, right?

This rationalization of the 47th president’s worst impulses is especially dangerous since it reinforces his own belief that he is never wrong. If he is encouraged to behave more erratically than ever, he will continue to reward destructive nihilism in his subordinates, and we’ll all go a bit mad just trying to keep up.",Left

It’s also an odd promise from “the ultimate peace president” who seemingly covets a Nobel Prize. It appears that the administration deploys “efficiency” and “peace” as diversionary rhetoric to obscure our president’s fixation on power and militarism.

We don’t have details on the defense budget yet, as the federal budget rollout is expected in May. But the details aren’t the point. “Nobody’s seen anything like it,” Trump told reporters Monday. “We have to build our military, and we’re very cost-conscious, but the military is something that we have to build. And we have to be strong because you’ve got a lot of bad forces out there now.”

Trump, much like his predecessors in both parties, sees extraordinary defense spending as exempt from typical considerations of efficiency.

Trump most likely chose the number — $1 trillion — because it is big, eye-catching and record-breaking. That would make sense for an administration more concerned with optics than policy execution. But suggesting a $1 trillion Pentagon budget also underscores that Trump, much like his predecessors in both parties, sees extraordinary defense spending as exempt from typical considerations of efficiency and as something that’s necessary for the maintenance of empire.

As DOGE has taken a chain saw to one federal agency after another, defense-related agencies have gone relatively unscathed. In March, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called for the termination of contracts, programs and grants that amounted to less than 0.07% of the Pentagon budget. Julia Gledhill, a research associate for the Stimson Center, a defense think tank, described the cuts as “a performative appeal to the American people” and as “nibbling at the edges of the Pentagon budget to shore up more funding for the president’s misguided priorities.”

Thanks to both parties, the defense budget is already unfathomably bloated. The government watchdog Public Citizen noted last year that the 2023 defense budget constituted more “than the spending of the next 9 countries [with the largest military spending in the world] combined and makes up 37% of global military spending, with the U.S. spending 3x more on its military than China and 8x more than Russia.” A trillion-dollar budget would mark a nearly 12% increase from current spending levels.

What on Earth is the extra money needed for? Trump’s odious military parade that he’s fantasized about for years could possibly come to fruition this year — but that would most likely cost a fraction of the proposed budget increase, so that can’t explain it.

More relevant are Trump’s hawkish tendencies. They’re different from those of most of his recent predecessors, but he is nonetheless still trigger-happy. During his first presidential campaign, Trump was a strident critic of the forever wars spawned by the so-called War on Terror, which was a welcome departure from both parties. And to his credit, he did set in motion the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet he has chosen to use his first months in office during this term to thump his chest and lay out a baldly imperialistic vision: seizing the Panama Canal, taking over Greenland, taking steps to potentially use military force against Mexico, insinuating that Canada, a sovereign nation, is potential territory to conquer. And his administration’s leaked Signal chat illustrated how his decision to bomb Yemen reflected an impulse to continue playing the role of the world’s policeman. Trump is no dove. Nor is he particularly interested in saving taxpayers’ money or using more of it to help people in need. To the contrary. He wants as much money as possible to get to boss the rest of the world around.",Left

The House GOP doesn’t have to pass the Senate’s version of the budget it received this week. But if that budget doesn’t pass and Congress then moves quickly to the reconciliation trailer bills —if the House rejects the budget outright or haggles through another round of grandstanding— kiss the majority goodbye and get your impeachment gear out and lined up.
Speaker Mike Johnson knows this. Majority Leader Steve Scalise knows this. Pretty much everyone with a working political brain knows this. But if President Trump and the House Leadership lose three of their GOP House members, the budget vote will fail. And in the wake of that failure will follow turmoil in the markets that could make last week’s look mild as uncertainty about the tax code on January 1, 2026 will add to the mix of fear and fog that is driving the market and business decisions for the past week.
The electoral tide chart tells us the GOP should lose the House anyway next year (the first Congressional election after a presidential election in which the majority party in the House loses that majority of it is the same party of the president.) Such a loss is not inevitable, but it is a recurring pattern with few exceptions. Those exceptions include 2002, when President Bush’s House GOP picked up 8 seats.
JOHNSON FACES UPHILL BATTLE KEEPING GOP DIVISIONS FROM DERAILING TRUMP BUDGET BILL
2002 was the most unusual of electoral contexts as it was the first referendum on Congress after 9/11. That’s not the sort of event anyone wants, so expect a ""normal"" cycle, one in which the GOP is paddling upstream.
President Trump won’t be on the ballot, so his unique pull on occasional voters will be diminished even if, as expected, he campaigns hard and long alongside other GOP draws like Vice President Vance, Senator Tom Cotton and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin.
Johnson and Scalise know they need not just an ""all-in"" effort but an unusual pattern of economic conditions to hang on to control of the lower House.
The Senate where the GOP holds a 53-47 edge is in better shape with GOP pick-ups possible in New Hampshire and Georgia, not impossible in Michigan and Minnesota, and Senator Thom Tillis as the only vulnerable GOP incumbent. (I know the Democrats will pour money into defeating Maine’s Susan Collins but ""Saint Susan"" is the most formidable of incumbents, always on the move on the state, chair of the mighty Appropriations Committee and genuinely beloved because of her decency, courtesy, intellect and courage.)
That ""unusual pattern of economic conditions"" most assuredly requires a growing if not a booming economy, and such an economy will need the promised trade deals to settle quickly in the aftermath of ""Liberation Day,"" but even more important to success in 2026 will be the extension and revision of the Trump 2017 tax cuts combined with construction of the wall, a defense buildup and soaring American energy production. It takes time for these powerful growth factors to kick in. The House GOP doesn’t have time for its show ponies to grandstand. It needs to act. Now.

The first thing I read each morning for the last four years was the top-secret President’s Daily Brief – a summary of the most sensitive intelligence and analysis on global issues. From the president on down to cabinet members and other senior officials, we relied on that summary to warn us about China’s aggressive cyber operations, terrorist plots, Iran’s malicious activities, and other geopolitical risks. Invariably, these insights were derived mostly from intelligence collected by one entity: the National Security Agency. Why? Because in a world defined by digital communications and technology, the NSA is America’s most effective intelligence service. 
That’s why the abrupt firings a few days ago of NSA Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Deputy Director Wendy Noble – two highly experienced and apolitical leaders – at a time when the U.S. is facing unprecedented cyberattacks from China and others is a gift to our adversaries. As President Donald Trump considers replacements for these vital roles, he and his national security team would be well-served to prioritize competence and leadership over politics. Here’s why.  
First, the NSA director and deputy director roles are unique in the U.S. government. Unlike the heads of other departments and agencies, who are primarily charged with overseeing policy, interfacing with external stakeholders and managing the workforce – all important tasks – they don’t need to be substantive experts to lead the agency.  
RARE CRIMINAL CONFESSIONS, BRITISH SPY SECRETS FROM 115 YEARS AGO UNVEILED IN NEW EXHIBIT
Not so at the NSA. By virtue of the highly technical nature of cyber operations and signals intelligence activities – intercepting the communications of our adversaries – it’s imperative that NSA leaders understand both the technical details and the strategic implications of the complex operations under their command.

They need to know how to build and deploy software platforms and code to launch cyber operations. They need to understand the cryptologic issues and programs that enable intelligence collection and harden U.S. defenses against cyberattacks. They also need to understand the immense power of the capabilities under their control.  
The horrific leaks by Edward Snowden illustrated the geopolitical consequences associated with expansive NSA operations even when you have competent professionals leading the agency. It’s no job for amateurs. This is precisely why presidents since NSA’s inception in 1952 have always selected leaders with deep technical expertise to run this highly sophisticated agency. Just as we need qualified doctors overseeing the emergency room of a hospital, we need competent, qualified leaders at the NSA.

Second, the decapitation of NSA leadership came at a time when China is undertaking increasingly aggressive cyber operations against the United States, as evidenced by the recent Salt Typhoon cyberattacks against US telecommunications networks.  
As Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated last month, ""Beijing is advancing its cyber capabilities for sophisticated operations aimed at stealing sensitive U.S. government and private sector information, and pre-positioning additional asymmetric attack options that may be deployed in a conflict."" These are not abstract threats.  
Turmoil at the NSA – the agency principally responsible for detecting and countering Chinese cyber espionage – could not have come at a worse time. The unprecedented firings, apparently without cause, will have a chilling effect on the workforce and morale at the agency and signal that politics is more important than apolitical, objective analysis and production that has always defined the intelligence profession.  
The impacts will be further amplified if other senior NSA officials retire or leave for more lucrative positions in industry to avoid becoming the next victim of baseless political attacks. The ultimate beneficiaries of chaos at America’s most consequential spy agency will be America’s adversaries, who will look to exploit the crisis.

The Trump administration has an opportunity to minimize the damage caused by these firings by selecting professionals with the competence and experience to lead NSA moving forward. This isn’t about politics, or at least it shouldn’t be.  
All Americans should care about having the best and brightest leading the NSA at a time when we’re facing rising threats at home and abroad – from China and Iran to ISIS and drug cartels. Choosing otherwise is a dangerous proposition that benefits only our adversaries.

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.

In June of last year, Leopold Aschenbrenner, a 24-year-old former OpenAI employee, published Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead, an urgent manifesto about artificial intelligence. “You can see the future first in San Francisco. Over the past year, the talk of the town has shifted from $10 billion compute clusters to $100 billion clusters to trillion-dollar clusters. Every six months another zero is added to the boardroom plans,” he wrote. “The AGI race has begun. We are building machines that can think and reason. By 2025/26, these machines will outpace many college graduates. By the end of the decade, they will be smarter than you or I; we will have superintelligence, in the true sense of the word.” What does that mean? Leave that question to your wildest dreams or nightmares, which Aschenbrenner summoned ably: total liberation for humanity or total repression or extinction.

The road to AGI, or artificial general intelligence, Aschenbrenner argued, has already been paved. AI-development “trend lines” have been accurate and will hold into the future; we’re “running out of benchmarks,” and soon “agent”-like helpers will be able to do the work of an AI engineer, speeding development of the technology past “human level” to “vastly superhuman.” First come $10 trillion companies, then a great-power conflict. “If we’re lucky, we’ll be in an all-out race with the CCP; if we’re unlucky, an all-out war,” he wrote. “But right now, there are perhaps a few hundred people, most of them in San Francisco and the AI labs, that have situational awareness … Let me tell you what we see.”

Less than a year later, Aschenbrenner has more company, and the AGI brand is strong. AI executives, some of whom have been talking in similar terms for years, are getting bolder. “We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,” wrote Sam Altman two months ago. Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, who prefers the term powerful AI and the image of a “country of geniuses in a data center,” suggested such a thing is attainable by 2026, “though there are also ways it could take much longer.” His own manifesto is slightly more hopeful, suggesting the technology could “structurally advance human health and alleviate poverty” but cautioning that he sees “no strong reason to believe AI will preferentially or structurally advance democracy and peace.” (For a dose of purely optimistic AGI-ism, here’s Ray Kurzweil last year: “We are going to expand intelligence a millionfold by 2045 and it is going to deepen our awareness and consciousness … In the early 2030s we can expect to reach longevity escape velocity where every year of life we lose through aging we get back from scientific progress.”)

Outside the labs, the population of people who may consider themselves situationally aware has expanded, albeit unevenly, as new research and products have reached the public. At the New York Times, Ezra Klein framed a recent conversation with a former Biden administration AI adviser thus: “The Government Knows A.G.I. Is Coming.” “For the last couple of months, I have had this strange experience: Person after person — from artificial intelligence labs, from government — has been coming to me saying: It’s really about to happen,” Klein wrote. A week later, columnist Kevin Roose echoed Aschenbrenner’s premise even more directly:

In San Francisco, where I’m based, the idea of A.G.I. isn’t fringe or exotic. People here talk about “feeling the A.G.I.,” and building smarter-than-human A.I. systems has become the explicit goal of some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. Every week, I meet engineers and entrepreneurs working on A.I. who tell me that change — big change, world-shaking change, the kind of transformation we’ve never seen before — is just around the corner.

Like Roose and Klein, I suspect that quite a few people with strongly held opinions about AI would be surprised to see what late LLM models can do today and that more such surprises will arrive, some shocking and destabilizing, in the workplace and beyond. I’m also open to the claim that, while instructive in many ways, early experiences of broken chatbots and absurd AI answers and summaries, not to mention the staggering proliferation of AI spam and slop, offer easy ways to write off technologies that are improving weekly. But I am not quite “feeling the AGI,” at least in the ways outlined above. My own resistance is easy enough to explain and, likewise, for a reasonable person to disregard. I don’t and couldn’t work in an AI lab as a research scientist, but rather I pass my days in an exposed and shrinking category of tech-adjacent knowledge work that demands — and instills! — heavy skepticism of the tech industry’s claims about itself. I’m also a lifelong sci-fi fan who grew up reading and rereading dazzling Vernor Vinge books about the singularity, wrung a thesis out of representations of machine consciousness in literature (we’ve been worried about it for a while), and allocated many hours of my one and only life to metabolizing arguments about superintelligence on the rationalist forum and longtime AI hub LessWrong, albeit in less heady times. Years later, I interviewed Kurzweil about his strange and short-lived e-book start-up while he took down handfuls of longevity supplements; now, Mr. Singularity is back in the spotlight, wondering if his time has come. In other words, I’ve been sitting with the AGI story for a while, and I’m probably unusually inclined to see it in narrative terms: as the description of a dream, a nightmare, or an ambition, rather than as a useful framework for understanding even incredibly powerful new tools.

Lost in AGI dread and gleeful anticipation is the fact that, while the technologies driving the discussion around AGI are novel and new, the stories we’re hearing about them are not. The AGI story today’s elites embrace is a retelling of the AI story embraced by the elites of yesteryear and the automation story of their predecessors. It’s fair to say we’re in uncharted technological territory, but that is also a truism. Where else would we be? As workers or as politicians, regulators, industrialists, or members of the curious general public, we have all previously confronted technological breakthroughs and moments of political and economic uncertainty. All those moments created opportunities for narrative invention, too. In its more cynical deployments, AGI, like AI before it, is a marketing story masquerading as a descriptive term; it’s a bid to rebrand — and narrow down and direct — our collective idea of the future.

Maybe this doesn’t matter, this time is completely different, and the end point of decades — centuries — of predictions about machine personification and eventual domination is finally at hand. History can’t tell us otherwise, and technological change really is coming (though, again, when isn’t it?). But it can make some helpful suggestions, and when it comes to stories like AGI, it has a few.

In his 2022 book Labor’s End, historian Jason Resnikoff re-creates a period in intellectual history that may feel, or at least sound, familiar:

“Hardly anybody is against automation,” wrote John Diebold. “As a matter of fact, nearly everybody is for it, because it is a word that implies progress” … A Ford manager credited with having invented the word called “automation” a “new concept — a new philosophy of manufacturing.” According to James Boggs, a Marxist Humanist and Black liberation theorist who worked on an automobile assembly line in Detroit for 20 years, “Automation is the greatest revolution that has taken place in human society since men stopped hunting and fishing and started to grow their own food,” and this required a “New Declaration of Human Rights” in which people were liberated from work.

Daniel Bell, a sociologist and public intellectual, wrote … that industrial work “has lost its rationale in the capitalist industrial order.” The union leader Walter Reuther told Congress, “We believe that we are really standing on the threshold of a completely revolutionary change in the scientific and technological developments we have experienced … we believe that we are achieving the technology, the tools of production, that will enable us as free people to master our physical environment.”

Pioneering computer scientist Norbert Wiener, Resnikoff notes, saw ahead to a “second industrial revolution” that would “undoubtedly lead to the factory without employees,” while Hannah Arendt wrote of “the advent of automation, which in a few decades probably will empty the factories and liberate mankind from its oldest and most natural burden, the burden of laboring and the bondage of necessity.” In 1960, JFK declared the prospect of mass automation to be a matter of urgent national importance to be considered carefully lest it become a “curse.”

This broad and rapid engagement with the new concept of automation was a response to both unsteady economic conditions and new and fast-moving developments in industrial processes, many accelerated by the war. It also corresponded with rising awareness of computers, which were suddenly capable of extraordinary, unintuitive, and narrowly superhuman things. GE, for example, told customers its data-processing systems could handle a wide range of sorting and bookkeeping tasks, “leaving the relatively small number of unusual operations to off-line human intervention where economics so dictate.” A 1955 IBM pitch both enticed and frightened white-collar management by invoking robotized assembly lines: “Factory automation, growing lustily, requires a corollary increase in office automation.” These companies weren’t just marketing new products; they were describing forces beyond their control and offering a way to side with them, or at least to buy insurance against them. (1955 was also the year that overlapping fields of study exploring frontier computing capabilities resulted in a new and durable coinage: artificial intelligence.)

As a story — and a brand — automation was simultaneously vague, expansive, and incredibly powerful. In 1958, after the country briefly fell into recession, The Nation suggested that the economic situation might soon be not just dire but unrecognizable and that urgent attention must be paid: “We are stumbling blindly into the automation era.” In “The Triple Revolution,” an open memorandum addressed to the president in 1964, a wide range of prominent signatories including technologists and activists warned of imminent “cybernation,” a term adopted and briefly popularized by Martin Luther King Jr. that demanded a complete rethinking of the economy and the government’s role in providing for citizens:

The cybernation revolution has been brought about by the combination of the computer and the automated self-regulating machine. This results in a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor. Cybernation is already reorganizing the economic and social system to meet its own needs.

These sorts of proclamations are, in 2025, commonplace — replace automation with AI, AGI, or OpenAI’s Super Bowl ad for “the Intelligence Age.” Like automation, they are terms adopted and marketed not for their precision but their novelty and vagueness. Automation was a new “mechanization” stripped of the drearier aspects of the legacy of the industrial revolution (very human despair, declining labor share of capital) and re-enchanted with a sense of gravity, mystery, and potential (whirring machines in empty rooms). Mostly, it’s familiar as a discourse of inevitability. Automation represented, Resnikoff told me, a claim that “that future isn’t a political question — it’s just the unrolling of technological development in itself.”

In the 1950s, lawmakers alarmed by “ever new and startling developments in automation” reported in “not only the trade magazines but the mass-circulation popular magazines,” held hearings on the subject. The definition of automation, Resnikoff writes, was a “consistent concern” that haunted and ultimately helped neutralize the project. The panel concluded that “the economic significance of the automation movement is not to be judged or limited by the precision of its definition” and that, in any case, they were “clearly on the threshold of an industrial age.” Awed by the future yet unable to agree on how to describe it, the committee concluded that “no specific broad-gauge economic legislation appears to be called for,” appealing to “enlightened management” to mitigate potential displacement and harms and warning labor leaders against “a blind defense of the status quo.”

After much deliberation, in other words, the imminent remaking of the economy, and humanity’s place in the world, was reduced to an awareness campaign. Broad-based “automation” was just a matter of time. It wasn’t the government’s place to tell businesses how to handle it, and it wasn’t the businesses’ place to do anything but enable it to its maximum potential, just … carefully. Automation framed the future in terms that made asking for things in the present — marginally better terms for workers, for example — sound like a waste of energy. It was, Resnikoff suggests, an argument for abandoning work, and the workplace, as a contestable, organizable, political space. Why bother? The end of work is nigh.

Fast-forward to 2025 when widely covered and debated government committees have largely been supplanted by a novel technology called “podcasts,” and we encounter the Times’ Klein interrogating former Biden AI adviser Ben Buchanan along similar lines:

This gets to something I find frustrating in the policy conversation about AI.

You start the conversation about how the most transformative technology — perhaps in human history — is landing in a two- to three-year time frame. And you say: Wow, that seems like a really big deal. What should we do?

Klein continues, “Is this policy debate about anything? If it’s so fucking big but nobody can quite explain what it is we need to do or talk about — except for maybe export chip controls — are we just not thinking creatively enough?” Buchanan, who describes a reluctant and slow process of engagement with AI by the Biden administration, responds, “I think there should be an intellectual humility here. Before you take a policy action, you have to have some understanding of what it is you’re doing and why.” That they find themselves at the same impasse as a congressional subcommittee from the Eisenhower administration is a little bit funny, but it’s also important. They’re describing — or at least responding to — the same sort of story in the same sort of way: an imminent and unstoppable big deal that changes everything and about which nothing can realistically be done.

AGI, like G-less AI, automation, and even mechanization, are indeed stories, but they’re also sequels: This time, the technology isn’t just inconceivable and inevitable; it’s anthropomorphized and given a will of its own. If mechanization conjured images of factories, automation conjured images of factories without people, and AI conjured humanoid machine assistants, AGI and ASI conjure an economy, and a wider world, in which humans are either made limitlessly rich and powerful by superhuman machines or dominated and subjugated (or perhaps even killed) by them (Industrial Revolution 3: The Robot Awakens). In imagining centralized machine authoritarianism in the future, AGI creates a sort of authoritarian, exclusionary discourse now. A narrative emerges in which the decisions of AGI stakeholders — AI firms, their investors, and maybe a few government leaders — are all that matter. The rest of us inhabit the roles of subject and audience but not author.

Even in its more optimistic usage, the term AGI still functions as a rhetorical black hole, ultimately consuming any larger argument into which it is incorporated with its overpowering premises: It’s coming; there’s a before and after; it’ll change everything; there’s nothing we can do about it; maybe, actually, it’ll be so smart that problem-solving will no longer be our problem. (This perhaps explains why interventions like Aschenbrenner’s, and their counterparts in media and elsewhere online, tend to skip ahead to final-battle geopolitical war-gaming with China for control over the technology — at least it’s something to talk about. If AGI is an enthusiastic exercise in sci-fi world-building, war is the afterthought of a plot.) Aschenbrenner concluded his manifesto with a tellingly claustrophobic reformulation of Pascal’s Wager, the philosopher’s 17th-century argument that you may as well believe in God: “At this point, you may think that I and all the other SF-folk are totally crazy. But consider, just for a moment: What if they’re right?” (In the spirit of taking things very seriously, one answer to this question would be “The government seizes Leopold Aschenbrenner’s superintelligence investment fund yesterday.”)

These formulations are very much a product of a broader political context. In the 1950s and early ’60s, it was plausible that a wide range of parties with different interests — industrialists, mainstream politicians, labor leaders, leftist theorists — might conjure futures from automation that were, if not utopian, not completely hopeless. At the very least, the business leaders who had seized the mantle of technological progress from the government were careful in how they talked about jobs. Private expressions of unease about labor and unemployment were in part what inspired Kurt Vonnegut to leave his public-relations job at GE to write his automation novel, Player Piano, but so were advanced machining technologies Vonnegut witnessed with his own eyes.

Today’s AI leaders, by contrast, have embraced the apocalypse as a marketing strategy, gesturing at future UBI while they wonder aloud if they’re bringing about the end of humanity, then the next week acting as though they hadn’t. In the process, they have successfully mainstreamed esoteric discourses about AGI and ASI while sidelining contemporary criticism of actual AI deployment. It’s not just about raising capital, a purpose for which AGI is an impossibly intoxicating (and, again, familiar) story. Within discussions about AI, what’s the point of getting bogged down in disputes over copyright or biased training data or even the quality and performance of currently deployed AI systems when everything is changing at an exponential rate? Beyond that, in the workplace, what’s the point of organizing or planning for the future at all? Beyond the workplace, with mindlike software just a few vivid dreams away from waking up, what’s the point of doing, well, anything? It’s fair to lament the rapid polarization of AI coverage and public opinion. I’d also suggest that the constant, knowing invocation of underexplained, variously defined, but obviously unstoppable “AGI” has a lot to do with it.

As I mentioned several years ago, it increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2025

It could also help explain why some discourses downstream from AGI are even bleaker than their predecessors. At the beginning of the American Century, technological determinism could take the form of inevitable automation that might change everything, might take everyone’s jobs, and might make everyone’s lives easier. (Harnessable machines with narrowly superhuman abilities to move or even compute.) Now, near the end, when Americans are as despondent as they’ve ever been about solving hard collective problems, it takes the form of a robot that can improve itself until it regards its creators in the way its creators regard bugs (unharnessable machines with superhuman abilities full stop). A recent Pew survey found wide gaps between the attitudes of AI experts and the skeptical general public, which is worried above all about the degradation of work. Fixation on imminent AGI by the nominally more optimistic experts doesn’t cultivate understanding or highlight a way forward. It feeds despair. It skips over countless decisions and fights about how technology is applied and deployed.

It has also become increasingly clear that AGI discourse, like automation discourses before it, is fundamentally a set of conversations between people who in some sense believe or want to believe they’re in charge and should decide what’s best for everyone else. Complicating matters is the fact that they perceive a threat to that status from AGI, which promises to be the new smartest guy in the room. This both limits the scope, utility, and reach of discussions about the underlying technology and helps explain just how panicked, strange, and disorienting they have become: In these versions of the story, it’s not just factory workers or office drones but the self-appointed cognitive elites who lose their place in the world too.

Those predicting dramatic short-term economic impacts of AI seem to have the impression that because AI is so powerful, disruptive, and general purpose, it will be adopted rapidly. But wait a second. The more advanced, general-purpose and disruptive a technology is, the more… — Arvind Narayanan (@random_walker) February 20, 2025

I don’t mean to suggest we should seek too much comfort in historical worries about technology and change. Many specific claims embedded in the automation discourse were, in hindsight, obvious and correct. It’s true that many Americans are today employed in jobs that didn’t exist when automation was a new term and that the rapid adoption of computers far more advanced than most could conceive of when the term was new — which have far exceeded early definitions of artificial intelligence — didn’t coincide with total societal breakdown but rather single-digit unemployment rates. It’s also true that this process, which was technological but also inescapably political, cultural, and meaningfully contested at every stage, resulted in job displacement, reskilling and deskilling, regional success stories, and regional apocalypses.

What’s most important about the discourse around automation is that the one thing its diverse participants seemed to agree on — that the country was at the cusp of a sudden, nonnegotiable step change — was also the one thing about which they were furthest from correct. The future turned out to be more complicated than an upgrade cycle: For the next 25 years, American employment in manufacturing increased and held relatively steady for 20 more; now, however, American automotive-manufacturing jobs, to choose one example, are diminished in both quality and quantity (they’re also sitting, albeit precariously, near a three-decade high). Now, manufacturing growth is nonunion; meanwhile, something close to true “lights-out” car factories are coming online in China as cars themselves turn into consumer electronics. The economy is larger and more productive but also more unequal.

America’s turn away from manufacturing and what came after were in part technological stories — by the ’90s, robots were actually eliminating auto-manufacturing jobs. It was also a story about trade, macroeconomic shocks, a massive service-sector boom, organized labor, and politics (e.g., your 401(k) this week). It was above all a story about thousands of decisions, choices, and fights, not fate. For Ford and companies like it, automation didn’t function as a prediction or a description so much as a statement of intention. Now, AGI is a repetition and an escalation. First comes the lights-out factory, then the lights-out office, then, finally, the lights-out mind. Any questions?

AI doomers: Can you imagine an advanced technology falling into the wrong hands, which would allow China to wreck our economy, throw markets into turmoil, interrupt manufacturing progress, disrupt our scientific infrastructure, and create global panic and confusion?



Me: Yes. pic.twitter.com/1EJ4RjjqDZ — Derek Thompson (@DKThomp) April 9, 2025

As Tressie McMillan Cottom writes, stories like this aren’t “held to account for being accurate, only for being compelling.” AGI is a suspiciously compelling story with the additional disadvantage of shrouding its purported subject in mystery. Within the AI community, some have raised concerns about the focus on AGI. In February, a group of researchers released a paper warning against using AGI as “the north-star goal of AI research,” arguing that it represents a series of “traps” that “undermines our ability to choose effective goals.” In Science, another group of researchers has argued that the focus on AGI has led to a deeper misunderstanding of the actual potential and transformative potential of LLM-based tools, which should be understood not as “general-purpose technologies,” like the steam engine or electricity, but as “cultural and social technology” humans can use to organize, access, and manipulate vast quantities of information, akin to markets, state bureaucracies, or even the printed word (or, more modestly, technologies such as online search).

None of these is a dismissive evaluation of technological change. (To paraphrase Paul Ford, describing LLM-based AI as software, or understanding the rush of strange and versatile new tools as the results of “vector databases queried with tokens,” isn’t a way to dismiss them. It’s just a different way to say they’re incredible.) They simply insist that our current and future situations are necessarily knowable and negotiable, not simply imminent or imminently inscrutable.

Google shared a useful contribution this week in the form of an earnest, exhaustive report attempting to identify AI risks and mitigation strategies that takes and defends AGI as its core premise. It’s a thorough and fascinating document about responsible technological development and deployment. It also invites a helpful exercise: In many of the specific instances where the term AGI appears, automation would suffice, of course, but so would generic “powerful software that could be used to hurt people” or, surprisingly often and with little loss of meaning, technology or just progress, despite the report’s detailed explorations of AGI in the novel terms of alignment, misuse, bias, and harms.

We’re far enough along in the AGI discourse that, even for some of the people who have most effectively promulgated it, it’s losing its utility. Departed OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, no stranger to “feeling the AGI,” recently argued against a core tendency of AGI-ism, pointing at the actual diffusion of LLM-based software so far, describing (and allowing for) a situation in which popular AI tools produce “disproportionate benefit for regular people, while their impact is a lot more muted and lagging in corporations and governments.” In contrast to sci-fi narratives in which AI is a “top-secret government megabrain project wielded by the generals,” he instead describes “versatile but also shallow and fallible” tools like ChatGPT “appearing basically overnight and for free on a device already in everyone’s pocket.” For others, the brand is simply becoming exhausted and dissolving into incoherence. In a recent interview with Stratechery, Altman described AGI as “a term that I think has become almost completely devalued,” outlining a wide range of definitions. Asked how he thinks LLM-based tools will evolve, he suggests that OpenAI is “on the path” to software that can “truly create new things” but also that, actually, OpenAI has “overdelivered” on its promises and “people have just updated” — they’re already taking for granted capabilities that just a few years ago would have inspired awe and perhaps even a “world meltdown.” Altman says his instinct is that AI “just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster.” After all, he says, “that’s kind of standard for other tech evolutions.”

These are the words of someone running a fast-growing consumer-technology company with discernable goals, needs, and competitors, not someone worried or excited that he’s about to create God. The same week Altman gave this interview, OpenAI joined other tech companies in submitting its proposals for the White House Office of Science and Technology’s AI Action Plan. Here’s how it framed the state of play:

As America’s world-leading AI sector approaches artificial general intelligence (AGI), with a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) determined to overtake us by 2030, the Trump Administration’s new AI Action Plan can ensure that American-led AI built on democratic principles continues to prevail over CCP-built autocratic, authoritarian AI.

There it is, back again! The fast-approaching threshold, the looming inevitability, the rapture, the storm. In conversation with a curious, critical interviewer, Altman dismisses AGI as a fuzzy story. When it’s time to stake a claim, back up a valuation, and ask for something from authorities — in this case, freedom from the copyright regime for training data — it’s an emergency. That, for OpenAI, is the value of “AGI.”

The AGI brand campaign has other uses with extraordinarily high stakes in the present and beyond the tech industry. DOGE is, above all, the manifestation of a right-wing dream to cripple the state and to commandeer what’s left. To the extent that it looks forward, however, it’s also a Musk-inflected AGI story put into action with real and current consequences. Who cares if we break the bureaucracy? Soon enough — inevitably, in fact — AI will be able to handle the messy work of governance and administration better than we can. Why isolate American industry from the rest of the world with massive tariffs? Because AGI robots will magically pick up the slack. Need to justify drastic cuts to Medicare or Medicaid? Just say “AI” and get out that bone saw. It’s a matter of time until all bets are off and the concerns of regular people will be well and truly irrelevant, their relative intelligence and intrinsic value reduced to a quantity approaching zero. Why shouldn’t the people in charge act like it’s already true? And why should any of us bother to do anything about it?",Left

Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered a wholesale rejection of President Donald Trump’s escalating trade wars and combative approach to foreign policy Wednesday night, urging Americans to remember their common humanity.

“We don’t have to hate China. We don’t have to hate other people. Let’s figure out a way to work together,” the Vermont independent said in a CNN town hall, hours after Trump raised his tariffs on Beijing to 125% amid a trade battle ignited by the president.

“The goal has got to be to break down these barriers that separate us as human beings — come together as Americans and come together globally as human beings,” Sanders said.

In the town hall moderated by CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Sanders fielded questions from audience members about Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs, the administration’s cuts to the federal workforce, Democratic struggles with young and Latino voters and more. His answers sought to address anxieties across party lines.

“People by and large are decent human beings who want the best for their kids,” he said.

Sanders, 83, returned to many of the same themes he has emphasized since launching his first presidential run in 2015.

But he did so with a new spin — highlighting Elon Musk’s spending on the 2024 election and his budget-slashing role in Trump’s White House as a totem for what he described as a “horrific drift toward oligarchy and authoritarianism.”

Here are four takeaways from the town hall:

Sanders, a supporter of some tariffs, knocks Trump’s trade policy

Sanders is among a handful of politicians on the left who have long been critical of free trade agreements and supported tariffs. But he also knocked the way Trump has conducted his recent tariff push.

One Republican voter from Virginia asked Sanders how he would assess the effectiveness of tariff strategies in protecting American jobs and what alternatives he would support. The Vermont independent said that he helped lead the effort against past trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, to “prevent the decimation of communities all over this country.”

“What these trade agreements, in essence, said to corporate America: ‘Hey, no problem. You can throw American workers out on the street. You can go to Mexico, you can go to China and hire people for pennies an hour,’” Sanders said. “And I thought that that was a horrible idea. It was a horrible idea.”

Sanders said tariffs “used selectively” are a good idea.

“But to arbitrarily, out of nowhere, come up with a tariff that they can’t even justify or explain to virtually every country on Earth is absolutely counterproductive,” he said.

Cooper asked Sanders about claims from the White House that Apple iPhones could be manufactured in America, despite assessments from economists that US made phones would cost thousands more. Sanders said he didn’t know if it would be realistic to make the devices in the US, but stressed that Trump’s tariff policies would cause “immediate harm” to working people through higher costs.

Sanders sees binary American choice: Wake up or ‘bow down to our new king’ Trump

Sanders warned that Trump poses a threat to democracy, describing several of the president’s actions targeting those who have opposed him or served as obstacles to his political goals as steps toward authoritarianism.

He highlighted what he described as attempts at intimidation: Targeting media outlets with lawsuits, law firms with executive orders, universities with threats of funding cuts and judges who rule against him with impeachment.

Asked whether he thinks Trump is serious about seeking a third term — which is barred by the Constitution, though Trump recently claimed that “there are methods” through which he could do so — Sanders said: “Yeah, I do.”

“What he wants is power and wealth for his oligarch friends. So nothing would surprise me about Trump,” Sanders said.

The president’s actions add up, Sanders said, to Trump seeking to set aside America’s constitutional separation of powers in favor of a system in which “one guy assumes all of the power.”

“That is not what people fought and died to create in this country,” he said.

Sanders said he hopes “the American people wake up,” and said the president is jeopardizing democracy in ways that go beyond political ideology.

“This is whether or not we remain a free society,” he said. “Or do we all bow down to our new king, President Trump? That is not the kind of nation I think we want to become.”

Sanders makes Musk the new face of oligarchy

Throughout his four decades in politics, Sanders has made pushing back against wealthy Americans’ outsized influence in politics central to his message. Those warnings haven’t changed, but the target has.

Sanders is among the many leaders on the left who’ve targeted Tesla billionaire Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to slash the size of the federal government.

Throughout the night, Musk served as a stand-in for Sanders’ warnings about American oligarchy, the wealthy exploiting American workers and the need for campaign finance reform.

After one voter asked Sanders what his message is to federal workers concerned about DOGE’s cuts, Sanders said the idea that Musk goes around with his “chainsaw,” a reference to Musk’s appearance at a conservative gathering earlier this year, is “outrageous.” He also warned that Musk could cause even broader harm to workers in the private sector.

“If Musk can do this to federal employees, some of whom are in unions … what do you think he’s going to be doing when artificial intelligence and robotics comes for your job?” Sanders said. “They don’t give a damn about you. If this is what they can do to federal employees, think of what they can do to people in the private sector.”

Sanders said that while the government should address bureaucracy, he didn’t think Musk was capable of doing it.

“Am I going to tell you the Veterans Administration is the most efficient organization in the world? No, it’s not,” said Sanders, a former chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. “But you don’t simply – with a chainsaw, if you like – get rid of 83,000 people, then say, ‘Oh, it’s not going to impact the quality of care that our veterans receive.’”

And as Sanders called out what he’s long criticized as America’s “corrupt campaign finance system,” he pointed to Musk’s role in the 2024 presidential election and his threats to fund primary challengers.

“When you talk about people losing faith in the American political system, it’s justified,” Sanders said. “The average American says, ‘Yeah, I got one vote, and Musk can spend hundreds of millions of dollars. Is that a democracy? Why should I vote?’”

Sanders seeks to ‘rally the American people,’ as Democratic leadership questions loom

As furious liberals have looked for ways to voice their opposition to Trump, Sanders is among the few national figures who have sought to answer the bell — drawing sizable crowds to rallies across the country this winter and spring.

But Sanders is nearly 10 years older than he was when his “political revolution” formed during the 2016 Democratic primary. And it’s not clear who will follow him — as the leader of the progressive movement, and as the voice channeling anti-Trump furor as the 2026 midterm elections approach.

Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, didn’t directly address those questions Wednesday night. He acknowledged splits within the Democratic Party over how to take on Trump, and argued for a combative approach.

“Within the Democratic caucus in the House and the Senate, you have people with different political persuasions,” he said. “There are some of us who from day one have understood that we’ve got to stand up and rally the American people to fight against this horrendous agenda, which at the end of the day is really significantly about giving massive tax breaks to the top 1%.”

Sanders name-checked just one other Democrat: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has appeared at rallies alongside him in recent weeks.

He said he is trying to “rally the American people to tell their members of Congress, guess what? You want to get reelected, you’re not going to vote to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut programs that working-class people need.”",Left

WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.

Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.

The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.

Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.

Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.

In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.

Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.”

It proved short-lived.

Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.

“Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal.

The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.

Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.”

But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.

Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.”

Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.

A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.”

Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said.

“He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path.

One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term.

Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.

Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.”

Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.

Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?”

After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention.

“People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions.

""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said.

He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency.

“We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.”

The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses.

Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned.

It's an argument President Donald Trump makes repeatedly as an end goal of his sweeping tariffs: America needs to bring companies and their manufacturing jobs -- back to the U.S.

That's a key reason, he says, that he imposed his hefty tariffs across the globe, with the heaviest levied on China, Vietnam and the European Union (although on Wednesday he put higher tariffs on some countries on pause -- excepting China).

""Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country,"" Trump said last week in announcing his tariffs. ""And ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.""

Making steel, aluminum and other products in the U.S. is a matter of national security, he added.

But on a practical level, experts say companies could take a long time to relocate, factories a long time to build and the cost of doing so -- plus higher American labor wages -- could make their products more expensive for American consumers.

Trump has 'fundamental misunderstanding': Expert

Some economists and international trade experts told ABC News that the president's controversial trade policy could actually discourage firms from setting up factories on American soil.

""Trump has a fundamental misunderstanding of how trade works. More domestic manufacturing does not mean a better economy,"" Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, told ABC News. ""It's an example I see a lot in 18-year-olds who turn up on the first day of my economics class.""

Wolfers and others contend that the decades of a U.S. shift from a manufacturing-heavy economy to one more based in financial and intellectual capital, tech and other white-collar fields, has done more to help American consumers and workers.

Wolfers said that Trump's tariffs are a ""solution looking for a rationale,"" given the disparity between manufacturing and other sectors, which have attracted a lot of talent domestically.

""One of the questions posed by the tariffs is should we undermine the competitiveness of the 140 million (non-manufacturing) jobs to satisfy the other 13 million (manufacturing)?"" he said.

Layna Mosley, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, told ABC News that the ""romanticizing"" of America as a global manufacturing superpower ignores the fact that American companies have found ways to deliver top products in demand worldwide by spreading out the supply chain.

""There is an idea that the U.S. used to do a lot of things domestically and the reason we didn't do that is that our economy has evolved,"" she said.

Mosley noted that the components such as microchips and textiles are deeply rooted in international manufacturing markets because they have greater access to those materials.

""Oftentimes, there is no substitute available,"" Mosley said.

A long time frame amid uncertainty

Even if companies do decide to abandon their international manufacturing sites and return to America, the economic experts said it will take an exceptionally long time for the American job market and consumers to benefit.

Trump himself admitted as much to reporters on Friday.

""Now, the good news is a lot of money for them, and they can build them fast, but they're still very big plants. I'd always say it would take a year-and-a-half to two years,"" he said.

Wolfers contended that firms will likely not announce plans to set up their factories in the U.S. as long as the uncertainty and instability Trump has started continues.

""If I'm a firm, what matters to my decision to make a factory is not the tariff rate in 2025 but the tariff rate in 2028 and later,"" he said. ""These tariffs can easily be removed by Democrats or even other Republicans and by the time that factory is up and running, it might be a bad investment.""

Mosley warned that even if companies do announce plans, their grand plans may not come to fruition as envisioned.

""I can imagine a few firms that will announce a factory. They figure it curries favor with Trump and he will declare victory, but many firms won't end up committing,"" she said.

A situation like this played out during the Trump first term. In 2018, Trump touted a Foxconn plant in Wisconsin that would build flat panel screens and create 13,000 jobs and invest $10 billion.

""This is the eighth wonder of the world,"" he boasted then at the announcement.

Three years later, following the pandemic and recession, Foxconn announced it was reducing its investment in the plant to $672 million and dropping its job numbers to roughly 1,400.

Mosely acknowledged that the appeal of blue collar jobs is strong for many Americans; however, she said the economic situation would make it difficult to bring back those jobs and workplaces.

James Anderson, the William B. Neenan, S.J. Millennium Professor in the Economics Department at the Boston College, told ABC News that even if the tariffs are fully overturned, the damage to America's reputation as a strong economic nation has been tarnished and would deter firms from moving to the U.S.

""What has happened now is that its destroyed the trust in the United States and the destruction of that trust is a generational penalty,"" he said.

Other countries have had better short-term solutions for those workers, such as paid vocational training and ""more generous"" unemployment options to help them transition to their new economies, according to Mosley.

""This is a massive political problem. The transition is not easy to make,"" she said.

Long term, Wolfers said the U.S. can increase its investment into preparing and training younger generations into the economic sectors that are showing growth, such as tech, and making the country a worldwide leader.

""It's bizarre to me we are trying to revive the economy of the 1950s when we are on the cusp of a major economic technical revolution,"" he said.",Lean Left

Former first lady Michelle Obama discussed stepping back and making time for herself on a podcast released Tuesday, addressing her recent absences from political events and rumors of marital troubles.

Speaking of her life eight years out of the White House with two adult children, Obama said on the “Work in Progress” podcast with actress Sophia Bush that she now has the opportunity to control her own calendar and can now make “a choice for myself.”

“I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom,” Obama said, “Maybe even as much as I let my kids live their own lives, I use their lives as an excuse for why I couldn’t do something.”

She continued: “And now that’s gone. And so now I have to look at my — I get to look at my calendar, which I did this year, was a real big example of me, myself looking at something that I was supposed to do — you know, without naming names — and I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”

The former First Lady notably skipped President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, as well as the state funeral of former President Jimmy Carter in January.

She went on to discuss the guilt of saying no and how her recent choices to step away from certain responsibilities raised rumors of a possible divorce from her husband, former President Barack Obama.

“I still find time to you know, give speeches, to be out there in the world, to work on projects. I still care about girls’ education. We, you know, the library is opening in a year from now. Certain things I am and am not doing with the library,” Obama said.

She continued: “That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people. I mean so much so that this year people were, you know — they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”

The Obamas have been together for 32 years, according to a post from the former president on X in October.

The former first lady has been open about how Barack Obama’s political ambitions and time in the Oval Office was tough on their marriage, writing in her book “Becoming” that it resulted in loneliness and exhaustion.

Since leaving the White House, Obama has spoken out against Trump and campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

During one campaign stop in Michigan just days before the 2024 election, Obama said: “Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us.”

She added: “Because a vote for him is a vote against us, against our health, against our worth.”",Left

Trump abruptly backs off major tariff plan after days of turmoil

By Rob Wile, Colleen Long and Shannon Pettypiece

One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.

In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.

The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place.

What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House.

“So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added.

Paxton kicks off a bitter GOP primary battle against Cornyn

By Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman and Frank Thorp V

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — an intraparty battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut him down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Direct or indirect, the U.S. and Iran are set for critical talks this weekend

By Andrea Mitchell

With the threat of U.S. military action against Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program hanging in the balance — a program Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes — officials from the Trump administration and Iran will meet in the Persian Gulf island nation of Oman this weekend to open talks about holding nuclear negotiations.

The United States will be represented not by Secretary of State Marco Rubio but by special envoy Steve Witkoff. Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.

President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.

The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.

Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”

Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face.

The Trump administration is preparing to send more immigrants with criminal records to El Salvador’s notorious mega prison on the heels of a Supreme Court order allowing the use for now of a sweeping wartime authority for deportations, according to two US officials.

El Salvador has emerged as a key US ally in Latin America as President Donald Trump pushes to advance his aggressive immigration agenda. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss the use of the country’s Cecot prison, the largest in the Americas. And the Trump administration has even fielded a recent proposal from private security contractor Erik Prince to establish a US-run migrant detention facility in El Salvador, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday the US would continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport people.

“It’s one of the reasons I went to El Salvador last week was a visit with the President. Asked him to continue to take terrorists from the United States of America that no longer belong here,” she said.

But the administration’s reliance on El Salvador as it seeks to ramp up deportations has proven to be controversial — prompting fraught legal battles and public pushback. This week, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to speed removals, but made clear that officials must give migrants subject to the measure adequate notice, so they have “reasonable time” to bring habeas complaints.

Those complaints have already popped up in some parts of the country. Federal judges in New York and Texas on Wednesday issued orders to temporarily halt the deportation of Venezuelan plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act.

Amid the legal back and forth, the administration fielded an unprecedented pitch from Prince, a long-time ally of Trump and a notorious private security contractor, to set up a US-run immigrant detention facility in El Salvador to detain immigrants with criminal records, according to the sources familiar with the discussions.

The idea gained traction in some corners of the federal government because some officials believed it would potentially be cheaper to detain immigrants abroad and help shore up detention capacity which is already stretched thin. But other US officials were more skeptical and have sought to knock it down, seeing it as legally tenuous and unrealistic.

The pitch revealed Prince’s influence on the Trump administration’s push for significantly tougher immigration enforcement and reflected the increasing interest in partnering with El Salvador and its Trump-friendly president in that effort. But the Supreme Court decision appears to have put Prince’s proposal for another facility on hold because sending migrants to Cecil remains a possibility.

CNN has reached out to both the White House and Prince for comment.

US officials who entertained the idea internally saw it as a way to avoid logistical challenges that have risen with the use of the Naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and skirt issues related to sending migrants to countries other than their place of origin, according to one source familiar with the discussions.

“Guantanamo is a PR statement that they have to figure out how to get out of. Logistically, it was a nightmare,” the source said.

In February, the Trump administration halted efforts to place migrants in tent structures built at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid concerns that the emerging facilities didn’t meet detention standards because they lacked air conditioning and electricity.

Trump has expressed support for sending US nationals to El Salvador as well, an unprecedented move that would face significant legal pushback.

“I’d love that,” he said when asked by reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One about a proposal from El Salvador’s president to take in convicted US citizens into the country’s high-security mega prison. “If they can house these horrible criminals for a lot less money than it costs us, I’m all for it, but I’d only do according to the law, but I have suggested that, you know, why should it stop just to people that cross the border illegally?”

Last month, the US removed 238 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua held by the US, along with 22 alleged MS-13 members to El Salvador to be detained in the country’s notorious mega prison.

The Trump administration has admitted to mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran national to El Salvador despite a previous order barring his removal to the country over fear of persecution — and come under fire for other cases that have cast doubt over the administration’s assertions that all those sent to the Central American nation were criminals.

The administration has signaled its desire to significantly ramp up immigration detention. A request for proposals for detention facilities posted by the administration totaled as much as $45 billion over the next two years.

Bukele is key to these efforts, and CNN previously reported that Prince’s direct line to the Salvadoran president has helped a former pariah of Washington establish himself back inside Trump’s orbit.

Prince, who is the brother of Trump’s former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, founded Blackwater, which gained notoriety in 2007 during the Iraq War, when its private contractors opened fire in Baghdad’s Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqi civilians. Four contractors were convicted and later pardoned by Trump. The company later changed its name and Prince sold the firm in 2010. He currently identifies himself on his website as an investor, entrepreneur and leader in military affair reforms.

Interviews with more than a dozen current and former administration officials and people close to Prince suggest that he has gained traction within the second Trump administration and is moving quickly to leverage his influence in pursuit of long-held policy beliefs, some of which could turn into big business for him.

Prince previously proposed deputizing private security contractors to swiftly deport undocumented immigrants. The proposal suggested hiring retired ICE and CBP officers, as well as retired state and local law enforcement and properly trained veterans to arrest people.

When asked about that proposal, Trump said he hadn’t seen it but “wouldn’t be opposed.”",Left

As Donald Trump’s administration settles into a global trade war — at least momentarily obscuring its war on the federal government and on the limitation of executive power, which continues on many fronts — it’s a good time for a reality check on the political capital he carries into the next turbulent phase of his second presidency.

For starters, all the triumphalist talk from MAGA-land of a huge popular mandate for governing and a new dominant Republican majority in the country really ought to stop. Following a brief (and entirely normal) post-election “honeymoon” of mild public approval (most of it probably based on relief over the end of the nightmarish 2024 campaign), Trump’s job approval ratings have very steadily (if slowly) declined since Inauguration Day. Looking at the Silver Bulletin polling averages (the most reliable available after ABC shut down FiveThirtyEight), which use a very inclusive survey database with results weighted for recency and demonstrated quality, the president’s job approval ratio was at 51.6 percent positive and 40 percent negative on January 20, producing a net positive rating of 11.6 percent. As of April 9, the ratio is now 45.5 percent positive and 50.8 percent negative, a net rating of minus-5.3 percent. Altogether, that means Trump’s net approval rating has dropped by 16.9 percent during the opening phase of his second term.

Looking at these numbers from a historical perspective, the most obvious take is that after a brief postelection blip, Trump is settling back into the state of relative unpopularity that has characterized most of his political career. With the exception of his earliest assessments before his shocking 2016 presidential-nomination win, and the brief if violent period of election denial at the very end of his first term, Trump has bumped along in the 40s on both job approval and personal favorability with net negative ratings. It’s about what you would expect of a politician with little appeal beyond his party base. It was just enough to get him elected in 2016 and close to reelection in 2020, despite sizable popular-vote deficits, and obviously enough to get him back into the White House in 2024 with a small popular-vote plurality. But the idea that Trump has fundamentally expanded his base of support is looking less likely every day.

Underlying his slow slide in job approval since reentering the White House have been indications that Trump is losing ground with some of the voter groups where he made crucial gains last November. A late-March CBS poll that provided reasonably good overall numbers for Trump (50 percent approval, 50 percent disapproval) showed 58 percent of Latino voters disapproving of his job performance with 42 percent disapproving strongly. Similar Economist-YouGov polling showed Trump’s net favorability rating among Latinos deteriorating from minus-11 percent in late January to minus-29 percent in early April with 54 percent registering “very” unfavorable opinions of Trump. Even more strikingly, the same polls showed Trump’s net favorability among under-30 Americans sliding from 5 percent on Inauguration Day to minus-29 percent now.

It’s very likely that these losses were concentrated among 2024 Trump voters who expected him to greatly improve the economy. Polls show his specific job-approval ratings for managing the economy have not been looking very good since his return to office. An April 1 Economist-YouGov survey showed a 45 percent to 48 percent approval ratio on Trump’s handling of “jobs and the economy,” which slipped to 40 percent to 53 percent on “inflation/prices.” A March 11 NBC News poll gave Trump a 44 percent approval to 54 percent disapproval job-performance rating on “the economy” and a 42 percent approval to 55 percent disapproval rating on “inflation and the cost of living.”

And another April poll, from Navigator Research, gave Trump his worst net job-approval rating on the economy (minus-13 percent) since they began tracking that in 2018.

Perhaps most impressively, a March 31 CBS News survey showed 64 percent of Americans thought Trump’s focus on lowering prices was “not enough.”

One specific negative influence on Trump’s public standing is the enormous attention Elon Musk has received for his destructive attacks on federal employees and selected programs and services. According to a new set of averages from Silver Bulletin, Musk’s favorability ratio is at 39.4 percent positive and 52.7 percent negative. And the intensity of public hostility to Musk can hardly be overstated. An April 2 Reuters-Ipsos surveyshowed 43 percent of respondents gave Musk’s job performance a very unfavorable rating. Similarly a March 27 Marquette Law School national poll showed Musk’s very unfavorable percentage at 46 percent. And most tellingly, a Blueprint poll of Wisconsin the day of a state supreme court election in which Musk was extremely involved and visible in a losing cause showed 48 percent of voters “strongly disapproved” of Musk’s activities at DOGE.

The most immediate problem for Trump going forward may be negative reaction to his “Liberation Day” tariff program, along with the market chaos it is currently causing and the longer-term impact it may have on consumer prices and economic growth. The initial signs are not good, as Silver Bulletin reported earlier this week:

We’ve had three entirely post-Liberation Day polls. None of them are good for Donald Trump. In today’s new Navigator Research poll, 44 percent of registered voters approve of Trump and 53 percent disapprove. And the latest Morning Consult poll showed Trump with a net approval of -6. Even Rasmussen’s daily tracking poll — where Trump has gotten some of the most positive approval numbers of his second term — has him 4 points underwater.

A fourth post–Liberation Day poll, the above-mentioned Economist-YouGov survey, also showed a five-point deterioration in Trump’s net approval rating in the last week. A fifth, from CBS News, showed a six-point drop in net approval since late March. And a sixth, from Quinnipiac, showed his net approval rating underwater by 12 percent. Everywhere survey questions are asked about Trump’s tariff policies, they rank among his least popular agenda items. Now that some tariffs (i.e., against China) have been raised again while others have been “paused,” it’s unclear what’s next and how it will affect Trump’s public standing. There’s not much evident optimism, though: The latest Reuters-Ipsos polls shows that 73 percent of Americans expect Trump’s tariff policies to boost consumer prices. If that actually happens, we could see Trump’s slow slide in popularity turn into something more like a crash.

Rep. Andy Ogles personally warned Speaker Mike Johnson not to go ahead Wednesday with a contentious House vote essential to advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda that had drawn scorn from the right.

After hours of scrambling to convince the Tennessee Republican and a dozen other defectors, Johnson finally obliged.

The speaker punted Wednesday night on that key vote on the Senate Republicans’ budget blueprint after failing to appease a group of House GOP conservatives demanding steep spending cuts. ​Now, GOP leaders will spend the coming hours in thorny talks about how to come up with more spending cuts — despite the Senate GOP’s firm resistance to any changes to their plan.

​Trump had spent recent days, even amid his own political calamity on his escalating trade war, trying to rescue the plan. But on Wednesday night, Johnson personally spoke with the president about the need to postpone the vote on the Senate’s budget blueprint in order to make concessions to the group.

“He understands it. He supports the process. He wants us to do this right and do it well, and sometimes it takes a little bit more time to do that,” the speaker said of his call with Trump.

Johnson told reporters there are “different ideas on the table” to secure the needed votes to pass the measure Thursday before the House leaves for a two-week recess.

“We have a pretty well-developed playbook and it’s got a number of plays in it and I just haven’t made the call on which one it is yet,” Johnson told reporters late Wednesday after delaying the vote.

The decision to push the vote, however, drew the fury of Johnson’s leadership team, who ultimately had to bend to the ultraconservatives after they made clear they would not budge on the party’s contentious budget measure as written. Just hours earlier on Wednesday, Johnson projected confidence: “I think it is going to pass today.”

Pennsylvania Rep. Lloyd Smucker, one of the Republican holdouts, said he is pushing for an amendment that would have binding language for higher spending cuts. One idea is for the budget resolution to tie the size of the tax cuts to deficit reduction measures — similar to Smucker’s idea in the House.

Smucker was among multiple Republicans who had warned Johnson that his plan didn’t have the support to pass. They included Ogles, who personally warned Johnson to not bring the party’s contentious budget measure to the floor.

“It’s going to fail,” Ogles recalled telling Johnson of the Senate-passed blueprint for Trump’s agenda.

Ogles and the other holdout Republicans are defying Trump on his push for a Senate GOP budget measure that tees up huge tax cuts and trillions of spending to hike the debt limit — all while committing to pay for just $4 billion of it.

Republicans like Ogles are refusing to commit to that budget plan until their party leaders can guarantee a serious deficit reduction push, including from the Senate. While Trump and GOP leaders’ fierce whip operation has limited some of those defections — down from as many as 50 members earlier this week — Johnson still faces a huge vote problem with his own conference as he attempts to pass the Senate measure Wednesday night.

The tension within the GOP conference is largely aimed across the Capitol at the Senate, which is far more squeamish on big spending cuts than the more conservative House.

“I trust the president, but I don’t trust the Senate. They’re a key part of this conversation,” Ogles said.

In recent days, Trump has made perhaps the strongest pitch of his presidency so far to House Republicans to back the measure. He personally summoned a group of Republicans to the White House for meetings, while dozens of others have received calls from his senior advisers.

In meetings on the Hill in the last 48 hours, Trump’s deputy treasury secretary urged GOP lawmakers to back the measure, while separately, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pitched potential future spending cuts in a meeting with House Judiciary Republicans, according to people familiar with the discussions. Johnson himself sat down with the Freedom Caucus meeting on Monday night, which resulted in a tense discussion about the budget.

“We want everybody all in because it unlocks the opportunity to do the reconciliation package, which is where the rubber meets the road,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, who leads the House GOP policy committee.

But Rep. Rich McCormick, who said he is “undecided” on the budget plan, estimated that 15 more of his colleagues are firmly opposed right now.

“There is a trust factor that’s been kind of betrayed in recent history so we’re all a little bit wary of this negotiation process. Not that the president’s lying to us, but that the Senate will roll and somehow or another, the people who don’t want to cut spending significantly will find a way to continue the spending at the level it is,” McCormick said.

Just last month, the Georgia Republican had to be personally convinced to vote for the president’s bill to fund the government through September 30. He recalled sitting in meetings where they discussed ways to tackle federal spending — but then, as he now recalled, “we did none of it.”

“If you keep on pulling the football from when I’m kicking, eventually you’re going to get a little wary,” McCormick told CNN of his hesitation to get in line again.

That chorus of House conservatives who are demanding these big cuts as part of Trump’s domestic policy megabill, however, is so far failing to force the Senate’s hand.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended his chamber’s decision to commit to no more than $4 billion in his package, even as he acknowledges it has been a huge sticking point for conservatives.

“It’s kind of a feature of how we draft them to comply with the Byrd rule. A lot of it is just kind of speaking different languages but we understand where they are coming from and are trying to address that and just make sure everybody is comfortable with moving forward,” Thune said Wednesday.

""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg said Wednesday that President Donald Trump didn't represent America in an address to viewers from other countries, as she promised the hosts would continue to complain about the administration's policies. 
""All you countries who watch us, this is not our wish,"" Goldberg said as her co-hosts emphatically agreed. ""This is not what the American people want. We don’t like it. We don’t like how it’s being – we don’t like how this is being done. That’s why you will hear us kvetching about this as long as we are able, because no one we’re talking to understands what’s going on, and, therefore, when they say America, they’re not talking about us.""
""They are talking about that very narrow band of America that they think they represent, that I think they don’t realize they’re starting to lose,"" the co-host continued.
Goldberg and the co-hosts of ""The View"" sharply criticized Trump's sweeping tariffs during the conversation. The president announced later on Wednesday that he would be instituting a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs but would increase tariffs on goods from China.

As Tulsi Gabbard completed her transformation from a Hawaii Democratic politician to a MAGA surrogate last year, she put down stakes in a far redder state. Gabbard and her husband bought a home outside of Austin and declared under oath last June that they were “resident(s) of the State of Texas.”

But a few months later, Gabbard voted in the 2024 general election back in Hawaii.

Election law experts said Gabbard’s vote, coupled with her claiming a homestead tax break on her Texas home, raises questions about whether she properly cast her ballot and illustrates the complexity of state voting laws.

Gabbard is now director of national intelligence under President Donald Trump. Trump has continued to press false claims of widespread voter fraud and demanded further actions by state and federal authorities to address it.

Representatives for Gabbard said she never intended to abandon her longtime Hawaii residency, despite signing the sworn declaration calling herself a Texas resident.

“Director Gabbard was, is, and intends to remain a Hawaii resident,” Gabbard’s lawyers, Jesse Binnall and Jason Greaves, wrote in a cease-and-desist letter sent to CNN prior to this article’s publication. “That is where she lives, pays taxes, and, of course, votes.”

Under Hawaii voting regulations, when voters have a homeowner’s tax exemption, that home is presumed to be their residence for election purposes.

Gabbard’s attorneys said she applied for a homestead tax exemption, which Texas law only allows on a principal residence, because she “took the advice of local officials” who told her it was required to shield her address from public view. Her office said she was facing a significant security threat.

Gabbard’s representatives did not respond to questions about why she separately swore under oath that she was a Texas resident if she considered herself to still live in Hawaii, and did not provide a comment from her after repeated requests.

It’s not clear whether Gabbard could have run afoul of voting laws in Hawaii or property tax laws in Texas with her actions. In their letter, her attorneys argued that “the definitions of residency for the purpose of voting in Hawaii and for claiming a homestead exemption in Texas are totally different, and on their face, not mutually exclusive.”

But Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University who studies election law, said Gabbard’s vote raised “a bunch of questions.”

“If she voted in Hawaii without actually living up to Hawaii’s eligibility standard, then that’s a problem,” said Levitt, who served as a voting policy adviser in the Biden administration. “Alternatively, if she always meant to keep Hawaii as home, that could well be a problem for that Texas tax exemption.”

Hawaii law says that individuals can only have a single residence for election purposes, and defines a voter’s residence as the “place in which the person’s habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever the person is absent, the person has the intention to return.”

If a voter has more than one dwelling, there is a “presumption” that a voter’s residence is the dwelling that is “subject to the homeowner’s property tax exemption,” state voting regulations say. There is also a presumption that if a voter takes up a new dwelling in another state, that new dwelling is their residence. The regulations allow voters to present evidence that they should still be allowed to vote in Hawaii.

Lance Collins, a Hawaii lawyer who has worked on multiple cases in the state in which voters challenged an elected official’s residency, said he thought Gabbard could face a challenge to her registration or an investigation into her vote in the 2024 election.

Under Hawaii law, voters keep their residency “until you take some affirmative action to abandon it,” Collins said. “Requesting a homestead exemption in another state is strong evidence of an intention to abandon.”

A political transformation

Gabbard, who grew up in Hawaii, has a long political history in the state. She became the youngest person ever elected to the state legislature at age 21, before being deployed to Iraq and Kuwait while serving in the state’s Army National Guard. Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress as a Democrat between 2013 and 2021, and ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary, eventually dropping out and endorsing Joe Biden.

After leaving elected office, Gabbard made a hard turn to the right, working as a Fox News contributor and endorsing and campaigning for Trump last year at events around the US. On the campaign trail, she echoed some of Trump’s rhetoric about election security, calling voting integrity “a serious concern and a serious issue” at one Trump campaign event in Las Vegas last fall.

In March 2024, Gabbard and her husband, Abraham Williams, bought a home in the Austin suburb of Leander, Texas, according to property records.

Several months later, in June, Gabbard and Williams declared under oath before a notary public that “we are resident(s) of the State of Texas,” and their Leander home was “designated as the family homestead,” according to a public document filed in Travis County, Texas, the following month.

Texas law allows some property owners, including public officials, servicemembers and veterans, to apply to have their address information made confidential in government appraisal records. Gabbard’s office said she sought that protection because her Texas house had been doxxed online, and she was facing a security threat.

Information related to Gabbard’s address has been blocked in Travis County records. A spokesperson for the Travis County appraisal district confirmed that only property owners who have applied and been approved for a homestead tax exemption are eligible for the protection.

“It is state law,” the spokesperson, Cynthia Martinez, said in an email. “A homestead exemption can only be claimed on a property that a person owns and occupies as their primary residence. The attorney general has clarified that the confidentiality protections under state law only apply to a homesteaded property.”

However, a “Designation of Homestead” – the type of document Gabbard signed swearing that she was a Texas resident – isn’t required in order to get a homestead exemption or to be part of the confidentiality program, Martinez said. The designation document has “nothing to do with a homestead exemption,” she said. It’s not clear why Gabbard filed it.

Making a false statement on a homestead exemption application, meanwhile, could lead to misdemeanor or lower-level felony charges, according to the state comptroller’s office.

Thanks to a homestead exemption, the annual property taxes for Gabbard’s house, which was assessed at a value of nearly $565,000, were reduced by about $1,200, according to a CNN analysis of a November bill from the Travis County Tax Office.

However, Gabbard likely would have benefited from the tax break in 2024 even if she hadn’t claimed the homestead exemption herself. The previous property owner also had a homestead exemption, and property taxes are typically calculated based on exemptions that were on the books on January 1 of each year, Martinez said.

Theoretically, Gabbard could also substantially cut her taxes by claiming Texas residency because the Lone Star State doesn’t tax income, while Hawaii has one of the highest income tax rates in the US. But Gabbard’s lawyers said she pays her taxes in Hawaii and intends to remain a Hawaii resident.

Sean Bukowski, a real estate lawyer in Texas, said that only Texas residents who make the state their primary residence can receive the homestead tax exemption.

“It is supposed to be your main homestead – that’s the whole point,” he said. If Gabbard considered herself a Hawaii resident, “she shouldn’t be getting a homestead exemption with the county for her taxes (in Texas), because that’s not her homestead.”

Spending time in Texas

Gabbard’s press interviews and social media increasingly showed her in Texas in the months before and after the election. About halfway through 2024, Gabbard’s background on some of her frequent Fox News appearances changed from the slope of Oahu’s Diamond Head crater to a view of the Texas State Capitol building in Austin. And her social media posts have shown glimpses of her spending time in the Lone Star State, like videos she posted of herself at a shooting range and gym outside Austin.

The financial disclosure that Gabbard filed in January after being nominated as intelligence director also lists a mortgage described as being for a “Personal Residence” that matches details of the couple’s mortgage on the Leander home.

Gabbard has not registered to vote in Travis County, a spokesperson for the county said.

A spokesperson for the Honolulu Elections Division said last month that Gabbard was actively registered to vote in Honolulu County. She’s rented a home on Oahu for about a decade, according to her landlord, who asked not to be named. While she has often been away from Hawaii in the mainland US in recent years, the landlord said, “she keeps paying me the rent.”

Another provision in the Hawaii voting regulations says that registered voters who are “employed in the service of the United States” can continue to vote in Hawaii while living out of state, even if their intent to return is “uncertain.” Gabbard is serving in the Army Reserve as a part-time commander of a battalion based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

But Collins, the Hawaii voting lawyer, said he wasn’t sure if there was any relationship between Gabbard “living in the state of Texas and her part-time service in the Army Reserves in some other state.”

Gabbard isn’t the only member of Trump’s Cabinet who’s faced residency questions related to their vote in last year’s election. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cast a ballot in New York State, even though a judge ruled last summer that he could not appear on the state’s presidential ballot because he used a “sham” address to claim New York residency. Kennedy had listed his address as a New York home he rented from a friend, even though he admitted having slept there only once, and largely spent his time in California, the judge concluded. Kennedy’s appeal of the ruling was not successful.

A liberal watchdog group, Accountable.US, filed a petition with the New York Division of Election Law Enforcement in January accusing Kennedy of violating state law. The division declined to comment about the status of the claim or whether it was investigating Kennedy.

Gabbard, meanwhile, could theoretically face a voter challenge to her Hawaii registration, or an investigation into her decision to vote in the state or her Texas homestead exemption.

Camron Hurt, the program director for Common Cause Hawaii, a non-partisan government watchdog group, said that while Gabbard’s declaration of Texas residency wasn’t “conclusive of wrongdoing,” it was “concerning.”

“As a public servant and high-profile figure, an explanation is owed,” Hurt said. “If circumstances warrant, Ms. Gabbard should be held accountable for her actions.”",Left

During the 2024 campaign, the “late great Hannibal Lecter” was one of Donald Trump’s favorite rally rants despite the fact that it was wrong in just about every conceivable way. Trump loved his error-ridden Silence of the Lambs bit so much that he even included it in his nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.

Trump did not mention Lecter in his inaugural address, and in recent months it almost seemed as if he’d forgotten about his cannibal friend. But on Tuesday night, the president remedied this mistake. Trump lauded the serial killer while speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, calling him a “very important force” in his reelection campaign. Trump said, according to Mediaite:

They used to go crazy when I talked about — when I talk about Hannibal Lecter. The late great Hannibal Lecter. Right? Silence of the Lambs. The fake news would say, “Why does he talk about that? He’s a fictional character.” He’s not. We have many of them that came across the border. He’s actually not. But when the people went to the voting booth, then we understood why he talked about that because they voted for us. They say, “We don’t want Hannibal Lecter in our country.”

The great Hannibal Lecter. He was, uh — he was a very important force. But the press would go absolutely crazy if I mentioned Hannibal Lecter’s name because they say he’s a fictional character. No, but it was making the point — and the point is they’re emptying mental institutions and insane asylums. Not anymore, they’re not.

If you only read Trump’s remarks, it looks as though he repeatedly denied that Lecter is a fictional character. This wouldn’t be that surprising since Trump often speaks about the serial killer, who was invented by the author Thomas Harris, as if he were a real person. But if you watch Trump’s speech, it seems what the president was trying to convey was “Though the press mocked me, my Silence of the Lambs metaphor was both correct and effective.”

@mediaite President Donald Trump offered a new spin on one of his classic rally lines about fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter on Tuesday night. ♬ original sound - mediaite

In reality, Trump’s Hannibal Lecter bit is still almost entirely wrong. Lecter is not “great,” as he’s an unrepentant murderer. Nor is he “late” since he does not die in any book, film, or TV adaptation. While Trump often claimed Lecter was a big MAGA guy, no actor who played him ever praised Trump, and several vocally opposed him. And most important, foreign countries were not “emptying mental institutions and insane asylums” into the United States during the Biden administration.

But sure — it seems that repeatedly telling a colorful, incoherent lie to demonize migrants might have helped Trump get reelected. Huzzah!",Left

Canada has a new U.S. ambassador to sort through its strained relations with Washington as the Senate on Wednesday approved President Donald Trump’s nomination of Peter Hoekstra in a 60-37 vote. 
His confirmation as U.S. ambassador to Canada comes at one of the most challenging times in Washington’s long relationship with its northern neighbor after Trump launched a series of tariffs targeting Ottawa and repeatedly claimed he believes Canada should become the U.S.’s 51st state. 
But despite heightened concerns over Trump’s ambitions for Canada, particularly among Democratic lawmakers, Hoekstra’s Senate confirmation process was a relatively smooth road.

""I do have a special appreciation for Canada as a neighbor,"" he told senators at his confirmation hearing last month.
Following questions from Delaware Democrat Sen. Christopher Coons, Hoekstra affirmed that ""Canada is a sovereign state.""
However, he declined to comment on the president’s repeated desire to incorporate Canada as the next U.S. state – a proposal Ottawa has consistently rejected.
""How the president and the relationship between the former prime minister in Canada and the characteristics, the nature of that relationship… I don’t know,"" he added.
The Michigan lawmaker and former ambassador to the Netherlands during President Trump’s first term referenced his state’s close ties to Canada during his opening remarks last month before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
""My home state is connected to Canada by four and soon to be five, bridge crossings along maritime board, across the Great Lakes, vital lakes that drive businesses, jobs and livelihoods in both states,"" Hoekstra highlighted. ""If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to build on that record of cooperation extended, obviously nationally.""

Canada is the U.S.’s largest trading partner and the number one purchaser of U.S. goods.
""I think there’s 36 states that see Canada as their number one trading partner internationally,"" Hoekstra confirmed. 
The U.S. is also, by far, Canada’s largest trading partner and top purchaser of Canadian goods, but Trump has repeatedly called the relationship ""unfair."" 
In 2023, the U.S. imported some $443 billion worth of goods, accounting for 72% of all Canadian exports, while Canada imported $317 billion U.S. goods, accounting for 49% of Ottawa's total imports.

In response, Trump slapped Ottawa with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian imports in a move to dissuade American consumers from purchasing Canadian goods, with the exception of energy imports, which saw a 10% tariff. 
Additionally, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and parts, which will also drastically affect Canada as automobiles are a chief export item to the U.S.

Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday allowed President Donald Trump to temporarily remove two board members at independent labor agencies while the justices consider whether the president may permanently fire them.

The brief order does not necessarily indicate which way the court is leaning in the case. Instead, the procedural move will give the justices a few days to consider written arguments before deciding whether or not to grant Trump’s request.

The emergency case follows a decision from an appeals court in Washington that temporarily reinstated Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, chairwoman of the Merit Systems Protection Board.

Roberts ordered the board members to respond to Trump’s emergency appeal on April 15.

Though the dispute is technical and involves agencies most Americans are not familiar with, it could have profound implications for Trump’s efforts to consolidate power within the executive branch – particularly if the conservative court takes Trump up on his request to hear arguments in the case later this year.

“The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration’s policy objectives for a single day – much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration’s top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in a filing earlier Wednesday.

The underlying lawsuit raises fundamental questions about the president’s authority to remove officials within the executive branch that Congress said could only be dismissed for cause – such as inefficiency or malfeasance – not because the president disagrees with their decisions. The conservative Supreme Court in recent years has moved toward expanding the president’s power to control independent agencies.

“This case raises a constitutional question of profound importance: whether the president can supervise and control agency heads who exercise vast executive power on the president’s behalf, or whether Congress may insulate those agency heads from presidential control by preventing the President from removing them at will,” Sauer wrote.

A three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals initially ruled for the Trump administration, but the full appeals court voted 7-4 on Monday to wipe out that decision, reinstating the board members.

“The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,” the DC Circuit majority wrote in its ruling Monday.

The Supreme Court in 1935 ruled that Congress may require presidents to show cause – such as malfeasance – before dismissing board members overseeing independent agencies. But in recent years, the high court’s conservatives have slowly chipped away at the independence of those agencies, giving the president more power to control all agencies that fall within the executive branch.

The DC Circuit’s decision reinstating two officials meant a quorum was restored at the NLRB and MSPB, allowing the agencies to function at full strength and process cases involving federal employment disputes. The agencies are a critical bulwark against Trump’s efforts to rapidly reduce the size of the federal workforce and fire thousands of employees.

All seven of the DC Circuit judges who supported reinstating the labor officials were appointed by Democratic presidents, and the four dissenting judges were appointed by Republicans.

The federal appeals court in Washington, DC, initially ruled that Trump could remove Wilcox and Harris.

“The Supreme Court has said that Congress cannot restrict the president’s removal authority over agencies that ‘wield substantial executive power,’” wrote US Circuit Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee.

This story has been updated following Roberts’ ruling.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump officially unleashed his latest volley of tariffs, levying extensive “reciprocal” taxes on the United States’s most prominent trade partners. As stock markets wavered as China and the European Union vowed to inflict their own retaliatory tariffs, Trump urged the American people to chill out. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!,” he said on Truth Social.

Then he caved. The president announced Wednesday afternoon that he had “authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.”

But Trump said the United States would be increasing its already staggering tariffs against China, raising the amount from 104 percent to 125 percent due to the country’s “lack of respect.”

“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” he said.

The impact of Trump’s announcement was immediate and obvious. In the minutes after, the S&P 500 went up 6 percent, the NASDAQ Composite gained 8 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by nearly 6 percent. By day’s end, the S&P 500 rose 9.5 percent, its biggest gain since 2008.

It was a remarkable about-face for the president, whose own administration had rejected the idea of a possible 90-day pause just days earlier. On Monday, an unsubstantiated rumor that Trump was mulling such a move briefly boosted the markets as investors believed an end to the global trade war was in sight. However, the White House quickly put an end to the speculation. “Wrong. Fake News,” an official X account read.

Trump attributed his sudden shift to the jitters he was seeing in response to his tariffs. “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippee, you know, they were getting a little bit yippee. A little bit afraid,” he told reporters outside the White House.

But naturally, top federal officials praised Trump’s backtracking as more proof of the former businessman’s dealmaking prowess. Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, wrote on social media, “Scott Bessent and I sat with the President while he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency. The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”

Bessent, the Treasury secretary, echoed Lutnick’s words while speaking to reporters outside the White House, saying that Trump “created maximum negotiating leverage for himself” and that the administration was overwhelmed by the number of allies who subsequently reached out and wished to negotiate “in good faith.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt instead used her praise of the president to also take aim at the media. “Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal. You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.”",Left

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a vociferous critic of President Donald Trump, of aggressively brushing him away.

It would have been more accurate for Martin to say that, in his office, no one is above the law unless they are a political ally of Trump, in which case you are free to behave with impunity. In a matter of weeks, Martin has turned one of the most important legal offices in the nation into an embarrassment, transforming it into a MAGA troll factory, launching pointless investigations and making empty threats.

In a matter of weeks, Martin has turned one of the most important legal offices in the nation into an embarrassment.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is the largest of the nation’s 94 federal prosecutorial jurisdictions, with 330 attorneys who routinely work high-profile cases that could range from a local murder to a transnational cybercrime outfit. Washington, D.C., also has an attorney general, elected by district residents, but it is the federal prosecutor, appointed by the president, who gets cases of any consequence, both for the district itself (violent crime) and the nation at large (Jan. 6).

Martin’s predecessor, Matthew Graves, prosecuted a Federal Reserve Board employee who was allegedly spying for China (he has denied the charges and a trial date is pending); partnered with the Department of Justice to seize a huge cache of Iranian weapons, which were promptly donated to Ukraine; and disrupted a fentanyl distribution operation (the defendants have pleaded not guilty).

It is true that Graves was too slow to respond to the rise of violent crime in Washington, D.C., which has been a priority for Trump. In that case, the president should have appointed a seasoned big-city prosecutor, and not the inexperienced Martin, who has never tried a case to disposition. He did, however, write a Trumpian coloring book (yes, really, but click at your own peril, because some of the worst graphic design in human history awaits).

Every administration has its share of servile apparatchiks, but few are as eager as Martin, who branded the federal prosecutors in his office “President Trump’s lawyers” in February, an astonishing admission that he has no interest in executing the duties of his office. In the weeks since, he has done nothing to dispel concern for his competence. If he is confirmed by the Senate, Martin’s jurisdiction will include cases related to financial crimes, political corruption and international terrorism. And if he isn’t willing to take those duties seriously, the rest of us could pay the price.

So far, seriousness has been hard to come by.

In one of his first moves on behalf of the American people, Martin sought to investigate Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer for a remark he made in 2020 about opposing Trump’s judicial nominees, preposterously claiming that the avuncular Brooklynite was advocating for real violence.

He also fired the prosecutors who worked under the direction of Graves on Jan. 6 rioters’ cases. Martin is a proponent of Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen and defended a few of the Jan. 6 rioters in court. “I’ve never seen anything so unfair,” he said of their prosecution on a podcast, according to NPR.

One brave D.C. prosecutor, Denise Cheung, resigned instead of following along with Martin’s sham investigation into “corruption” at the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, Martin is seeking to reverse some of President Joe Biden’s pardons because they had supposedly been signed with an “autopen,” a tool presidents have long favored.

Republicans’ claims to be the party of law and order would be far more credible if they stood with Democrats in blocking Martin’s confirmation.

Almost as soon as Trump’s term began, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency engendered nationwide fury by closing down entire federal departments (like the U.S. Agency for International Development) and firing federal workers without any cause. In response to the blowback, Martin wrote a groveling letter in which he promised to chase the supposed malefactors “to the end of the Earth,” whether they had committed a crime or “even simply acted unethically” (another sign that Martin does have a rudimentary understanding of his position). Martin was so infused with righteous fervor that he managed to misspell “no one,” which can’t have gone over well in an administration that claims to put a premium on hiring “seriously high IQ individuals.”

“DC Prosecutor Ed Martin Keeps Inventing New Ways To Disgrace His Office,” is how one headline on a prominent legal blog put it. Sure, you can chalk that up to Acela elites looking down their noses at Martin. But if Republicans are not infuriated by the above, many of them are nevertheless embarrassed by the fact that the Ed Martins and Laura Loomers of this world wield so much power in Washington. Yet they keep making the mistake of thinking that if they just look the other way, MAGA’s more unseemly elements will simply disappear. And maybe congressional Republicans really believed that in 2017, when “I haven’t seen the tweet” was a common refrain on Capitol Hill. But that fiction is impossible to maintain in 2025.

Republicans’ claims to be the party of law and order would be far more credible if they stood with Democrats in blocking Martin’s confirmation, which is supposed to receive a hearing soon in the U.S. Senate (that hearing has been delayed because Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has placed a hold on the Martin nomination). GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee like Ted Cruz of Texas (who graduated from Harvard Law) and Josh Hawley of Missouri (a Yale Law guy) should see if Martin can run with the big dogs. After all, they’ve had no problem displaying their erudition before Democratic nominees. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., has a razor-sharp legal mind. It’s hard to believe that he has much regard for Martin. If that’s the case, he should not hold back.

In an open letter, more than 100 former prosecutors call Martin “egregiously unqualified.” This isn’t about politics. It’s not even about the law, or how Martin feels about Marbury v. Madison or New York Times v. Sullivan.

Martin is a former tea party activist whose rise through the ranks of the Missouri GOP involved allegations of bullying and political retribution (which he has denied), all while climbing the ranks of power. In 2013, he won election to head the state’s Republican Party, despite the fact that Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., as well as six Republican House legislators from the state, all opposed his bid. His latest, highest post is a thank you from Trump for Martin’s advocacy for the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, whose base behavior that day D.C.’s new prosecutor has consistently misrepresented and downplayed.

Trump is not wrong about Washington’s struggle with public safety (though he typically exaggerates the prevalence of homeless encampments and the rise in crime, which has subsided). Criticism that Graves was not attentive enough to local concerns does carry some merit, in my view. And many people in the district would indeed welcome more concerted attention to quality-of-life concerns. I will say that I am glad that Martin went to speak to residents of Ward 7 and 8, the historically Black sections of Washington. His comments on gun crime seem to have been fairly reasonable, at least in relative terms. But people did not come away convinced. “He works for the biggest criminal in the world,” one local resident told the Washington Informer, “and he comes here to tell us about crime.”

During the first few days of the Trump administration, MAGA activists bullied GOP senators like Joni Ernst and Thom Tillis when it seemed like they might vote against Pete Hegseth, who ultimately won confirmation to be the secretary of defense. I am confident that Martin will not engender similar passion among Trump’s faithful: He is a Trump 1.0 guy trying to hang on in a Trump 2.0 world. And even if he does, isn’t it about time for Republicans to show some backbone and stand up to Trump? This is as good an opportunity as any.",Left

Donald Trump’s growing global trade war expanded even further Wednesday as his administration officially instituted sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” against the United States’ international trade partners. The new taxes ranged from 20 percent on the European Union and 32 percent on Taiwan to a staggering 104 percent tariff levied against China, whose leaders immediately retaliated with an 84 percent tax on American goods. Then, abruptly, Trump announced that he was instituting a 90-day pause on all of those tariffs, except for those on China — which are actually going up to 125 percent.

Before the pause, Trump was experiencing a rare thing: mild pushback on policy from the Republican Party, even among some of his most stalwart supporters.

During a Fox News roundtable with several of his Republican Senate colleagues on Tuesday, Texas senator Ted Cruz urged Trump to come to a deal with other nations to lower tariffs on both sides, arguing that it was the ideal outcome for the American people. “I do want to give a word of warning: There are voices in the administration that rather than take a deal are saying, ‘we want to have tariffs as a long-term, permanent feature of the economy.’ I think that’d be a mistake,” Cruz said.

He continued, “If a year from now, our trading partners have all jacked up tariffs on America and we have high tariffs on everyone, I think that’ll hurt this country.”

North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, who is considered one of the party’s most vulnerable incumbents, used far more colorful language to express his concerns about the country’s tariff policy during a hearing with U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer. “Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?” he asked. Tillis continued, “It just seems like we’ve decided to begin a trade war on all fronts — and that’s okay, if the person who thought this through has an answer for why you go after partners that we have a very long, storied relationship with.”

But in a floor speech later that day, Tillis suggested the media had been “lazy” in its reporting of his comments to Greer. “I support what’s going on right now with trade,” he said, per Semafor.

“The whole debate is so fundamentally backwards and upside down,” GOP senator Rand Paul said in a CNBC interview. “It’s based on a fallacy, and the fallacy is this: That somehow in a trade someone must lose. That somehow, when you trade with someone, there’s a loser and someone’s taking advantage of you and China is ripping you off or Japan is ripping you off. It’s absolutely a fallacy. Every trade that occurs in the marketplace is mutually beneficial.”

Some Republicans are considering their legislative options to act as a check on Trump’s trade decisions. Last week, Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, joined with Republican senator Chuck Grassley to introduce the Trade Review Act of 2025, which would curb the president’s powers to implement tariffs and allow Congress more of a say on such policies. As part of the legislation, Congress would have to be notified within 48 hours of any new tariffs or changes to existing ones. Lawmakers would also be required to pass a resolution approving the tariff within 60 days and have the ability to end any tariffs through a similar mechanism.

In addition to Grassley, the bipartisan bill already has support from seven Republicans in the chamber, including Tillis, former Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Indiana senator Todd Young, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Maine senator Susan Collins, and Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas. Axios reports that at least a dozen House Republicans are considering supporting a similar bill proposed by Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska.

This is not the first piece of legislation aimed at rolling back Trump’s tariffs. Senator Paul and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon put forward a resolution on Tuesday that would repeal the president’s tariffs by eliminating the emergency declaration used by Trump to put the taxes in place.

However, the lawmakers in favor will likely face an uphill battle. House Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to waver in his support for Trump’s trade policies and said recently that the House will give Trump “space” to see his efforts through. In the Senate, any legislation would require 60 votes for passage in the Republican-led chamber.

And there might be an even bigger short-term obstacle. Punchbowl News reported Wednesday that House Republicans plan to use the budget resolution rule to block the filing of any disapproval resolutions through September.

Trump responded to the growing opposition to his tariffs during his remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, mocking the members of his party looking to rein in his powers. “These countries are calling me up, kissing my ass,” he said. “And then I’ll see some rebel Republican, some guy that wants to grandstand and say, ‘I think that Congress should takeover negotiations.’ Let me tell you, you don’t negotiate like I negotiate.”",Left

At a fundraise… [+5912 chars]","Washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on a Republican budget plan, lacking enough GOP support to get it over the finish line on Wednesday.

Several House Republicans have resisted increasing pressure from President Trump to swallow a blueprint that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.

The resolution's passage was in peril heading into the planned vote, making it a gamble for Johnson, who huddled with conservatives off the House floor as the preceding vote was held open for more than an hour while he tried to flip the holdouts. It's the latest setback for Johnson and creates further uncertainty about the future of Mr. Trump's agenda.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the vote could be rescheduled for Thursday morning.

At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to ""close your eyes and get there."" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate on Saturday.

But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution — just about $4 billion — compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.

""They have to do this. They have to get there,"" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but ""just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there — you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.""

The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that ""they always vote in unison,"" saying, ""you don't see somebody that's holding up.""

""One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get ""every little ounce — it doesn't work that way.""

Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a ""massive victory"" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued ""they will not be able to even touch your seat,"" and he predicted they'd pick up ""40, 50, or even 60"" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.

""If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,"" the president continued.

On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.

""Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,"" he said. ""The USA will Soar like never before!!!""

Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.

After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.

The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as ""current policy,"" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.

The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a ""current law"" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.

Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that ""there's no way"" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution ""anemic"" and ""a joke.""

GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to ""see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.""

Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda ""nonsense.""

""I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,"" he added.

During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has ""concerns"" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.

Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that ""the math still doesn't math.""

""The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,"" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.

Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to ""come show me the math.""

""I will not vote for this bill,"" Roy said. ""Because it is not responsible.""

NASA Administrator nominee Jared Isaacman will appear before the committee at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, making the case for his leadership during a new era for the fabled agency.

Isaacman is expected to use his opening statement and testimony to express his commitment to furthering NASA’s mission to land on Mars as well as returning astronauts to the lunar surface – the latter a priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), chair of the committee whose state is home to the Johnson Space Center and a robust commercial space sector.

Cruz and Isaacman met the week before the hearing, after which Cruz tweeted that the nominee “committed to having American astronauts return to the lunar surface ASAP so we can develop the technologies needed to go on to Mars.”

“The moon mission MUST happen in President Trump’s term or else China will beat us there and build the first moonbase,” Cruz added. “Artemis and the Moon-to-Mars Program are critical for American leadership in space!”

Trump started the lunar program, now called Artemis, during his first year in office. But in his January inauguration address, he mentioned sending American astronauts to Mars but not the moon.

“We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars,” he said.

Isaacman would have his work cut out for him leading the agency, navigating bureaucratic and budgetary burdens as well as the politics of leading the agency. But as the administration nears its 100th day, NASA would unquestionably benefit from the confirmation of a new leader.

“I’m glad the Senate has scheduled a hearing to consider Jared Isaacman’s nomination as NASA administrator,” Acting Administrator Janet Petro told Breitbart News in a statement. “Isaacman’s experience in commercial spaceflight and his commitment to advancing space capabilities align with NASA’s ongoing efforts to enhance America’s position as the global leader in space exploration. Upon confirmation, his leadership will support our work to drive American innovation, strengthen partnerships, and further the essential mission of the agency for the benefit of all.”

Isaacman has a unique background for leading the agency. The 42-year-old billionaire spent his teenage years fixing credit card machines, starting his first business at 16 years old before founding Shift4 Payments, a successful payment processing company.

By 2011, Isaacman, a certified pilot, began chasing another passion – aviation and space exploration.

That year he founded Draken International, a company specializing in providing military-grade aircraft for training purposes.

Within a decade, he had traveled to space.

In 2021, he led and funded Inspiration4, the first all-civilian space mission aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. He also launched the Polaris Program, a series of private space missions which included 2024’s Polaris Dawn, during which he accomplished the first commercial spacewalk by a civilian.

Bill Nelson, former President Joe Biden’s NASA administrator and former U.S. Senator until his defeat by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), often bragged about traveling to space while a member of Congress.

Isaacman’s two space flights double Nelson’s lone visit.

That record clearly impressed Trump.

When announcing Isaacman’s nomination in December, Trump praised him as “clearly an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut” who “will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration.”

Many others believe Isaacman is the man for the job.

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Rep. Bob Walker wrote in February for Breitbart News that Isaacman is the “inspirational leader” NASA needs, whose nomination “represents a unique opportunity to combine the ingenuity of the private sector with the might of the federal government.”

“Given the golden age of American innovation that President Trump intends to build, NASA needs a leader with the vision and experience necessary to think beyond old models and drive the agency to new heights,” they said. “That leader is Jared Isaacman.”

In addition to his business success, Isaacman holds multiple aviation world records, including for fastest flight around the world in a light jet.

Isaacman’s confirmation hearing can be watched online here.

China's tourism ministry has issued a new ""risk alert"" about the U.S. to Chinese travelers amid the trade war with President Donald Trump.
""Recently, due to the deterioration of China-US economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the United States, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism reminds Chinese tourists to fully assess the risks of traveling to the United States and be cautious,"" the ministry said in its alert on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, China's Ministry of Education has issued a warning for students considering studying in the U.S.
The new advisory comes after the state of Ohio passed the Higher Education Act, which includes provisions negatively impacting Chinese-American academic exchanges. The Ministry urges Chinese nationals to carefully assess safety risks and increase their awareness of potential challenges when selecting U.S. states, particularly those affected by the new restrictions.
The ministry's alert, issued on Wednesday, highlights concerns over the worsening China-U.S. economic and trade relations, as well as the domestic security situation in the U.S. It advises Chinese tourists to carefully evaluate the risks of traveling to the U.S. and exercise caution.
The move follows steep declines in global markets, driven by growing concerns that the trade war could cause widespread economic damage well beyond the U.S. and China.
In April, President Trump imposed tariffs on numerous American trading partners, prompting many to retaliate with their own measures.
The updated travel guidance by China comes as Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Germany, France and the U.K. have all issued new travel guidance for those wishing to travel to the U.S. in response to President Trump's crackdown on immigration and trans rights.
Beijing's motivation is centered around the opening rounds of a renewed trade war with the U.S.
China announced it will raise tariffs on U.S. imports to 84 percent in response to President Donald Trump's latest tariff hike on Chinese goods, adding 50 percent to the previous rate of 34 percent, after Trump's increase to 104 percent as of Wednesday.
Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of countries went into effect on Wednesday.
These new duties, announced on April 2 during a speech from the White House Rose Garden, are in addition to the 10 percent tariff the president imposed on all global imports starting on April 5.
The administration claims the measure will address long-standing global trade imbalances that have hurt the U.S. and encourage companies to move their manufacturing operations to the country.
President Trump said in a speech to the NRCC on Tuesday night: ""After all of the abuses they've perpetrated, China is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs...That's why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place, effective midnight tonight, at 104 percent.
""Until they make a deal with us, that's what it's going to be. I think they'll make a deal with us at some point. China will. They want to make a deal, they really do...they just don't know how to get it started.""
""The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system,"" China's finance ministry said in a statement.
There are no indications that the U.S.-China trade dispute will deescalate anytime soon, with both sides maintaining a firm stance.",Center

These unfolding trade conflicts have deeply rocked financial markets. Investors fear the economic fallout may lead to a recession in the U.S. and elsewhere as tariffs drive up prices for businesses and consumers and upend global supply chains.
The EU package was proposed in response to Trump's 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum. The tariffs, which will be collected from April 15, will also be 25 percent.
The EU published a list of goods proposed to be affected by the tariffs in March. These included industrial products such as textiles, leather goods, home appliances, house tools, plastics, and wood products.
It also included agricultural products spanning poultry, beef, certain seafood, nuts, eggs, dairy, sugar and vegetables.
The Commission said in a statement that the EU ""considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy.""
""The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the US, which would be balanced and mutually beneficial,"" it continued.
""These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome.""
Trump unleashed reciprocal tariffs worldwide on Wednesday, imposing a 20 percent minimum tariff on all EU imports to the U.S. He had already imposed higher tariffs on metals and auto imports.
When the EU suggested broadening its response beyond steel and aluminum tariffs to include other U.S. products, Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European alcohol, including French wine.
Trump sees tariffs as a tool to protect domestic manufacturing businesses from unfair global competition or to open up open markets such as the EU's so American businesses can sell more freely in them.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, on Monday: ""We stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners.
""Because Europe is always ready for a good deal, so we keep it on the table. But we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests.""
President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday: ""The EU has been very tough over the years, I always say it was formed really to do damage to the United States in trade, that's the reason it was formed.""
""We're paying them to guard them militarily and they're screwing us on trade, so that's not a good combination,"" Trump said.
Trump's previous angry response to the EU's proposed countermeasures and the current tit-for-tat trade exchanges with China suggest the U.S. will retaliate strongly against European tariffs.

President Donald Trump’s nominee for NASA administrator, billionaire space-junkie Jared Isaacman, will face questions at Wednesday’s confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a list of civilian astronauts that will be joining Isaacman at the hearing, some of whom previously traveled on missions to outer space with the 42-year-old entrepreneur. 
Scott ""Kidd"" Poteet, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel and former Thunderbird pilot, will be one of the astronauts attending in support of the Trump nominee. On the recent September Polaris Dawn spacewalk, Poteet acted as mission pilot and had worked with Isaacman on previous spaceflight efforts.

Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX and one of the first female mission controllers at the company, and Anna Menon, a biomedical engineer and lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, both worked with Isaacman on the Polaris Dawn mission and will be attending the hearing in his support. 
The nominee will also be joined by former colleagues behind the historic 2021 Inspiration4 mission – the first civilian-led spaceflight to orbit Earth. Dr. Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and analog astronaut who served as mission pilot, Chris Sembroski, an aerospace data engineer and U.S. Air Force veteran who served as mission specialist, and Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and a pediatric cancer survivor who became the youngest American to orbit Earth at 29.
Sembroski was gifted the seat in a raffle by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital during a fundraising campaign for the mission, which raised $250 million for the cancer center in addition to Isaacman’s personal $125 million donation. 
Isaacman will be introduced to the committee by Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., who told Fox News Digial ahead of Wednesday’s hearing that ""for nearly 70 years, the United States has been at the forefront of space exploration. President Trump knows how critical it is to reinvigorate NASA so we can once again lead the world to new heights, and that’s why he chose exactly the right man for the job: Jared Isaacman.""
""A successful innovator, entrepreneur, pilot, and astronaut, Jared believes in NASA’s core mission,"" the Montana senator told Fox. ""He has the experience and skillset to ensure we continue to lead in the greatest frontier ever known, and I look forward to adding NASA administrator to his already remarkable resume.""

Additional senators have already spoken out ahead of the hearing, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who posted on X Monday, saying, ""During our meeting, Mr. Isaacman committed to having American astronauts return to the lunar surface ASAP so we can develop the technologies needed to go on to Mars.""
""The moon mission MUST happen in President Trump's term or else China will beat us there and build the first moonbase,"" Cruz continued. ""Artemis and the Moon-to-Mars Program are critical for American leadership in space!""
Fox News Digital also obtained Isaacman's opening remarks for the nomination hearing, where he intends to highlight the importance of multi-planet travel and his plan to ""prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars. Along the way, we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the Moon and determine the scientific, economic, and 3 national security benefits of maintaining a presence on the lunar surface.""
The Trump nominee's remarks also touch on the value NASA brings to the U.S. ""not just to expand our knowledge or strengthen our national security, but to improve all life on Earth and inspire the next generation to reach even further.""
""This is why America needs NASA – why the world needs NASA – because there is no more important investment than inspiring our children to build a better, more exciting future. And the best way NASA can do that is by delivering on our mission and ushering in a new Golden Age of Science & Discovery – and we will not fail.""

Isaacman may face questions about recent reports that SpaceX founder and DOGE head Elon Musk intends to ""take over"" the space administration, and congressional Democrats have also been critical of Musk’s involvement in space travel. Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, D-Fla., and Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., sent a letter to NASA chief legal officer Iris Lan in an attempt to snuff out any association between the world’s richest man and U.S. space funding. 
But a senior official at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. told Fox News Digital Tuesday, ""NASA's acting administrator, Janet Patro, is leading the agency under the Trump administration. Neither Elon Musk nor SpaceX holds any influence over the agency's priorities.""

Isaacman amassed his $1.3 billion fortune as founder and CEO of Shift4 payments, a credit card payment processing company. The entrepreneur dropped out of high school at just 16 after working at a payment processing firm, and would eventually use a $10,000 check from his grandfather to build a tech empire. 
In comparison to the previous NASA administrator, former astronaut and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, some critics have referred to Isaacman as an outsider.

Fox News Digital spoke with NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens in March, who pushed back, saying, ""President Trump was also once considered an outsider, and the American people have put him back into office, just showing how much they appreciate the business side that he brings to the table. And Mr. Isaacman also has a background as an entrepreneur of an extremely successful business.""

The Trump administration has implemented its agenda in rapid fashion since January, instituting steep cuts across the federal government and workforce and wielding its power over the nation’s cultural and educational institutions. But no other city has felt the brunt of Trump’s policies like New York as the president looks to force his political ideas upon his traditionally Democratic hometown. The federal government has sought to shutter the city’s congestion-pricing program and challenge the leadership of Columbia University while clawing back millions of dollars in federal funds allocated to the city’s migrant care. Here’s a look at some of the ways that the city has been challenged by the federal government.

Congestion pricing

The city’s long-awaited and divisive congestion-pricing program went into effect following the New Near after a scuttled launch in June prompted a revamp that lowered the proposed toll from $15 to $9. But the future of the program was immediately called into question when Trump entered the White House. Trump had long made his opposition to congestion pricing known, calling the program a “disaster for NYC” last year and vowing to “TERMINATE” the toll if elected to a second term.

The administration attempted to fulfill that promise, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in February that the federal government was pulling its approval of the city’s congestion-pricing program. In a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul, Duffy cited the fact that the program is intended to generate revenue for the transit system rather than the highways and said the tolling zone leaves commuters without a “free highway alternative” to travel to their destinations. “I do not believe this is a fair deal,” he said.

Soon after, the Metropolitan Transit Authority filed a lawsuit in federal court, arguing that the government doesn’t have the ability to unilaterally end congestion pricing. “It’s mystifying that after four years and 4,000 pages of federally-supervised environmental review — and barely three months after giving final approval to the Congestion Relief Program — USDOT would seek to totally reverse course,” MTA executive Janno Lieber said in a statement.

Hochul has also vowed to keep the tolling program’s cameras on as the legal challenge proceeds, denouncing the administration’s action as an attempt by Trump to exert his will over residents. “I don’t care if you love congestion pricing or hate it,” she said at a press conference. “This is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington.”

Though the government initially gave an official deadline of March 21 to wind down the program, Duffy later gave the state a 30-day extension paired with a threat. “Know that the billions of dollars the federal government sends to New York are not a blank check. Continued noncompliance will not be taken lightly,” he wrote on social media. That deadline will likely be pushed back even further following reports that the federal government and the MTA have agreed on a timeline to present their arguments in court, delaying any further action until at least October.

The federal case against Eric Adams

It was last September that Manhattan federal prosecutors unveiled an indictment of Eric Adams, alleging that the mayor knowingly solicited illegal campaign contributions from Turkish nationals in exchange for luxury travel perks, among other offenses. Though Adams professed his innocence in the matter, the five-count indictment led to calls for his resignation, which he quickly rebuffed.

With Adams due to stand trial in April, the mayor was soon the center of numerous overtures from Trump himself, who compared his own legal plight to the mayor’s and said the two New Yorkers were the victims of a political vendetta from the Biden administration. Unlike his fellow big-city Democratic mayors, Adams struck up a far more cordial relationship with Trump, vowing to work with his administration and not against it and even traveling to attend his inauguration in Washington, D.C.

The legal saga appeared poised to derail Adams’s reelection campaign until the mayor received a late-stage intervention from an unlikely source. In February, the Trump Justice Department directed the Manhattan prosecutors to drop their pending case against Adams, arguing that former U.S. attorney Damian Williams had political motivations behind the case and that the charges were hindering the mayor’s ability to support federal immigration-enforcement efforts.

Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney, resigned in protest, saying that Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove’s directive to her office to drop the case amounted to a “quid pro quo” between Adams and the federal government. Several Justice Department officials would follow her, tendering their own resignations rather than carry out Bove’s order.

The issue then came before District Judge Dale Ho, who was set to preside over Adams’s trial in April. Ho sought to hear the arguments from both sides as well as an outside view from Paul Clement, an experienced litigator and former solicitor general. Last week, Ho officially moved to dismiss the charges against Adams “with prejudice,” meaning that the Trump administration would be unable to revive the case in the future. Though Ho’s ruling aligned with the government’s wishes, the judge notably criticized its reasoning for the dismissal and signaled that he believed some of the arguments against dropping the case had merit. “Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,” he wrote.

FEMA funds

In February, comptroller Brad Lander said his office discovered that the Trump administration had revoked $80.5 million in FEMA funds allocated to the city government. The money, disbursed by Congress as part of the agency’s Shelter and Services program, was intended to go to the city’s migrant shelters. “This is money that the federal government previously disbursed for shelter and services and is now missing. This highway robbery of our funds directly out of our bank account is a betrayal of everyone who calls New York City home,” Lander said at the time.

The revocation appeared to have its roots in a social-media post from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wrote that his DOGE team had “discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.” He alleged, without evidence, that the funds were coming at the expense of disaster relief, despite money from FEMA’s shelter program originating from a separate part of the budget. Musk’s words prompted the interim FEMA administrator to freeze the funds and the subsequent firings of agency staffers, who were accused of “circumventing leadership” to allow the payments but with no further detail provided.

The city officially filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, calling the revocation of funds unlawful. “The $80 million that FEMA approved, paid, and then rescinded — after the city spent more than $7 billion in the last three years — is the bare minimum our taxpayers deserve. And that’s why we’re going to work to ensure our city’s residents get every dollar they are owed,” Adams said in a statement.

However, the federal government did not stop there. The New York Times reported Tuesday that FEMA is canceling $106 million in grants for the city’s migrant care with the agency seeking the money’s return. In addition, the agency cut $300 million in grants intended for flood mitigation in the state. “These cuts are a complete dereliction of duty from FEMA and will put lives at risk. Shame on them,” Hochul said on social media.

Columbia University





Though the Trump administration has targeted numerous colleges and universities, arguably none has been more on its radar than Columbia University. Since the divisive on-campus protests against the conflict in Gaza last year, conservatives have directed their ire at Columbia, calling for an overhaul of the Ivy League school’s policies and leadership.

In March, the federal government announced that it would be cancelling $400 million in grants and contracts with Columbia, citing the university’s “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The Trump administration issued an ultimatum Columbia would have to comply with to save its federal funding. The university was ordered to enforce steep punishments of students who participated in the Gaza encampments and building takeovers; institute a mask ban; and agree to place its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under an academic receivership for five years. Columbia would go on to agree to the federal government’s terms.

The administration has also begun to target the university’s students as part of its crackdown on campus activism. In one of its highest-profile cases, ICE agents arrested and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who played a role in the Gaza protests on campus, despite his having a green card.

DEI policies

On the campaign trail, Trump frequently railed against diversity-equity-and-inclusion programs, vowing to remove DEI policies and teachings from American schools and even threatening to revoke funding from institutions that don’t follow his directives. But in April, New York signaled that it would not be complying with the federal government’s order on the subject.

Daniel Morton Bentley, counsel and deputy commissioner of the state education department, wrote in a letter that the state is “unaware of any authority” that the U.S. Department of Education has to force compliance without a formal process. “​​We understand that the current administration seeks to censor anything it deems ‘diversity, equity &inclusion,’” he wrote. “But there are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.”",Left

Frenchman David Pereira grew up watching dubbed versions of American TV shows like “The A-Team,” “Happy Days” and “The Dukes of Hazzard” in France.

He was obsessed with American culture: he used to collect vintage Mustangs, owns a GMC pick-up truck from the ’70s, and has visited the US nearly a dozen times. This summer, he was looking forward to fulfilling a lifelong dream and visiting Yellowstone National Park with his family, after having completed a successful circuit of national parks on the West Coast two years ago.

But after following Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric for months, the 53-year-old business owner said he couldn’t, in good conscience, go through with it and has canceled the trip.

“Like many French people, we are immersed in American culture. So we love it. But it’s just unbelievable now,” Pereira, who lives about an hour north of Paris, told CNN Travel.

“I kept watching the news and thinking, ‘this can’t be happening.’ It was getting worse and worse. It was just fake news on fake news on fake news.”

Similar feelings of disbelief, anger, anxiety and fear that beset America’s neighbors, Canada and Mexico, have spread across the Atlantic, where European travelers are canceling planned visits or rethinking their US travel plans amid the Trump administration’s hostile anti-European rhetoric and tariff war.

Safety concerns following a string of plane crashes and cuts affecting the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as stories about tourists being thrown into detention centers without due process or being denied entry possibly because of anti-Trump views, have also heightened travel anxiety.

In response, countries like Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Germany, Finland and Canada have issued new travel updates warning citizens that travelers can be denied entry even with the appropriate visas and approvals, or that transgender travelers must indicate their biological sex at birth in their passports and could face added difficulties entering the US.

Chilling effect

As cautionary tales of travel to the US began to pile up, British writer Farah Mendlesohn knew that she had to forfeit the month-long trip that would have taken her from Scotland to Oregon, Seattle and Vancouver this summer. Three years in the making, her plan was to conduct research at a public university for a book on a science fiction writer that she was working on, and to volunteer at the sci-fi Seattle WorldCon convention and visit friends.

But after reading about a Welsh woman who was detained for 19 days in the US and sent home in chains after being accused of working illegally while on a tourist visa, Mendlesohn canceled her trip and lost £800 (about $1,050) in travel bookings.

She also feared that her left-leaning political stance (she edited a deliberately provocative 2007 sci-fi anthology titled “Glorifying Terrorism” to challenge sweeping British anti-terror laws in 2006) would have gotten her into trouble at the border.

“As well as my own political views, I don’t think I want to go to America in those circumstances and put money into the American economy,” Mendlesohn said.

On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to minimize concerns international travelers may have of coming to the US and being detained, saying those who are flagged at the border are flagged “for a reason.”

“If you’re not coming to the United States to join a Hamas protest, or to come here and tell us about how right Hamas is, or … stir up conflict on our campuses and create riots in our streets and vandalize our universities, then you have nothing to worry about,” he told reporters in Brussels.

But the chilling effect among international travelers is starting to bear out in the numbers.

New figures from the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) show that overseas international arrivals for the month of March dropped 12% compared to the same period last year. That figure excludes arrivals from Canada and Mexico.

After forecasting a 5% dip for inbound travel to the US this year in February, travel forecasting group Tourism Economics has revised its projections, telling CNN Travel that it now expects that figure to almost double to 9.4%.

Summer hotel bookings from European travelers for Accor properties in the US are also down a whopping 25%, CEO Sébastien Bazin said in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV. Accor hotel brands include Fairmont, Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and Raffles.

Jean-François Rial, CEO of France’s leading luxury tour operator Voyageurs du Monde, said that ever since Trump’s inauguration in late January, bookings for US travel among his wealthy French clients have dropped a “colossal” 20%.

“In the 30 years I’ve been in this business, I’ve never seen anything like this for any destination. It’s huge,” he told CNN Travel.

Rial also criticized the US government for downplaying the impact of Trump’s policies on international travel, and said that colleagues in the industry in France are reporting similar trends.

The NTTO’s 2025-2029 forecast, published in March, projects that total international arrivals will increase nearly 7% this year to 77.1 million, spike another 10% in 2026 for the World Cup, and then dip down to a 6% increase in 2027 — numbers that seem overly optimistic, Rial said.

“When the US says there’s no impact on travel sales from the Europeans to the US, they’re wrong. There you go. They’re talking nonsense.”

CNN Travel reached out to NTTO for comment on the forecast but didn’t hear back. The NTTO forecast is based on travel and economic trends through the end of 2024.

‘We’ve never seen this kind of turnaround’

Didier Arino, general director of travel consulting firm Protourisme in France, also said that anti-Trump sentiment has led to an “unprecedented” drop in interest for travel to the US, which is the leading long-haul destination among French tourists.

“It’s unheard of. It’s happened before in a country at war, in a county where there was a security risk, or risk of health crisis, but in a normal situation, we’ve never seen this kind of turnaround,” Arino said.

British long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic has recently warned that demand for transatlantic travel to the US has slowed.

The NTTO’s 2025-2029 forecast of a nearly 3% increase in Canadian tourist arrivals in 2025 is also at odds with recent stats showing a decline in Canadian travel to the US.

According to figures from US Customs and Border Protection, the average number of daily travelers crossing the Canada-US land border by car fell 15% in February from 92,983 to 79,407 this year compared to the same period last year. Likewise, transborder air travel from Canada to the US was down 2% in February, marking the first month to record a year-over-year decrease since the start of the pandemic.

And flight bookings between Canada and the US for travel between April to September show a precipitous drop of more than 70% compared to the same period last year, according to aviation analytics company OAG.

But while Canada’s largest airlines Air Canada and WestJet have axed seats in response to plummeting demand, OAG chief analyst John Grant said there have been no significant adjustments from Europe or other international markets so far, mostly due to the logistical challenges that presents. And while airlines may try to stimulate demand by lowering prices, he pointed out that the days of post-pandemic revenge spending are over.

“Let’s not forget that the vast majority of tourism in the United States is still domestic tourism,” he added. “And if that holds, the loss of a few million people from Europe could be absorbed.”

‘Wrong on so many levels’

A grassroots boycott movement that started in Canada is also gaining momentum in Europe, with “boycott USA” groups on Facebook from countries like Denmark, which leads the charge at 95,000 members, Germany, Italy, France, UK, Norway and Sweden attracting new members daily.

For Swede Johan Björnsson, canceling his 2026 cruise out of Miami is an important gesture, even if it means losing a $500 deposit. He’s never been particularly political, Björnsson said. But the moment he saw clips of Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, the 43-year-old said he knew he had to take a stand.

“It had nothing to do with politics, it was just a crude assault. It was disrespectful and wrong on so many levels. It got personal,” he said. “That was probably the drop that made everything go over for me.”

For Europeans living close to the war in Ukraine, the threat of Russian aggression across the continent looms in the background. Last month, the EU Commission urged its 450 million citizens to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours in the event of emergencies like cyberattacks, climate disasters, disease and also geopolitical conflicts.

“Peace and stability are intrinsic to the European project. Yet, Europe faces a new reality, marked by growing risks and deep uncertainty,” read the first lines of the EU’s 18-page European Preparedness Union Strategy.

Trump’s alignment with Putin, suspension of aid to Ukraine and the administration’s general anti-Europe rhetoric are seen as deep betrayals across the continent. In a leaked Signal thread published by The Atlantic, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”

And during a visit to Greenland, a semiautonomous territory in the kingdom of Denmark, last week Vance upbraided Denmark, saying they have “not done a good job” for the people of Greenland, in a speech that was largely viewed as hostile and insulting.

“We consider the US to be our best friend,” said Jacob Bøll, a consultant who lives in Copenhagen. “Now, we’re not only not friends anymore, it’s like our friend started a fist fight with us.”

The turn of events has driven Bøll, 52, to cancel travel plans to Cincinnati where he was to visit close family friends this summer, and then travel to Nashville. He was also planning to attend the World Cup soccer tournament next year, but now will only go on the condition Denmark plays in Canada if they qualify.

“I just can’t imagine a scenario where I would go back,” he said. “You vote with your feet when you’re a consumer.”

After much deliberation, fellow Dane Robert Christiansen has also canceled plans to fly to Texas this summer and surprise his teenage daughter, who is studying in Dallas. But Christiansen said fears of flight safety and his own activity on social media, where he shares the latest news stories as his small act of resistance, would have made him anxious about his travels.

“I cannot trust the government of the United States,” Christiansen said.",Left

The budget resolution vote in the House of Representatives has been postponed after GOP leaders were unable to win over enough holdouts on Wednesday evening.
Speaker Mike Johnson said he was still hopeful that the House could pass the budget blueprint this week, but ""if we have to come back next week, we will do that.""
Johnson added that he had spoken with President Donald Trump about the decision to delay the blueprint vote.

Liz Cheney has accused President Donald Trump of a ""Stalinesque targeting of political adversaries"" after he signed two executive orders directing the Justice Department to investigate two former officials.
Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday targeting former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who wrote a book and op-ed criticizing the president, and his first term election security director Chris Krebs, who could not find any evidence that the 2020 election was ""stolen.""
In a post on X on Wednesday, Republican Cheney wrote, ""In a special mix of incompetence and evil, Trump has combined his disastrous implementation of 1930s tariff policies with Stalinesque targeting of political adversaries.
""The 2020 election wasn't stolen and speaking the truth is only a crime in countries ruled by tyrants,"" she added.

Donald Trump's former White House Homeland Security and Counter Terrorism Advise, Olivia Troye, has called the president's orders for the Justice Department to investigate former officials he views as disloyal, as ""incredibly disturbing.""
Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday targeting former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and his first term election security director Chris Krebs.
Trump's order accuses Krebs of being part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election after the election security director said that he was unable to find any evidence of the widespread voter fraud Trump had alleged.
Taylor was accused of being a ""bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government position,"" after he wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed, and later a book, describing Trump's first term and the administration's alleged efforts to prevent the prevent the president was damaging the country.
The orders revoke their security clearances and call for the Department of Justice to investigate their actions in government.
Troye wrote on X: ""This is incredibly disturbing. I warned Trump would do this & that he would falsely try & claim 'treason.' He's issuing Executive Orders targeting Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor—two Republican officials who served in his first admin. Ordering the DOJ to investigate them—for what? For telling the truth? This isn't justice. It's retribution. This is authoritarianism plain & simple.""

Germany's incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he believes that Europe's determination to fight back against Donald Trump's tariffs, were the reason he announced a 90-day pause on Wednesday.
""From my point of view, it's a reaction to the Europeans' resolve,"" Merz said on German TV channel RTL.
He cited E.U. official Ursula von der Leyen, who had pledged, ""We are determined to fight back.""
President Donald Trump is expected to hold a Cabinet meeting at 11 a.m. ET tomorrow, the White House said.
During last month's cabinet meeting, Trump discussed his plans for the tariffs and several executive orders. 
Tariffs are likely to loom large over Thursday's meeting too after Trump announced a 90-day pause on his ""reciprocal"" tariffs.
The House of Representatives did not vote Wednesday night on the budget bill supported by President Donald Trump, a fiscal plan that would effectively secure his agenda.
Early concern whether the Republican bill had enough GOP support prompted Trump to throw his political weight behind it on social media, calling it ""imperative"" for Republicans to pass it.
Conservative Republican representatives like Chip Roy of Texas and Thomas Massie of Kentucky have been well-known hard-liners against passing larger budget bills.
Passing the bill is critical for Trump's strategy, including tax cuts, to move forward and maintain a cohesive working relationship with House Republicans.
The House moved forward with a procedural vote of 216-215 earlier in the evening to allow a final vote of the bill. Three GOP lawmakers voted against the procedural rule.

Speaker Johnson said he was still hopeful that the House could pass the budget blueprint this week, but ""if we have to come back next week, we will do that.""
He added that he would not keep members in session over the weekend however, due to the Jewish holiday of Passover on Saturday.
President Donald Trump escalated his campaign of retribution on Wednesday, signing two memoranda directing the Justice Department to investigate two former officials from his first administration and stripping them of any security clearances they may still hold.
The move targets Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, and Chris Krebs, Trump's former top cybersecurity adviser.
In response to Trump's remarks, Taylor issued a statement on X: ""I said this would happen. Dissent isn't unlawful. It certainly isn't treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man's point.""
The move marks an intensification of Trump's efforts to use presidential power to punish critics and perceived enemies.
Read in full from Gabe Whisnant on Newsweek. 
House Speaker Mike Johnson said that he has spoken to President Donald Trump about the need to delay Wednesday's vote on the budget blueprint vote.
""He understands it,"" Johnson said, referring to Trump.
""He supports the process. He wants us to do this right and do it well, and sometimes it takes a little bit more time to do that,"" the speaker said.
Johnson had pushed ahead with tonight's vote on the blueprint but came up against a group of House GOP conservatives who are demanding steep spending cuts.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday welcomed Donald Trump's 90-day pause on some tariffs charged on trading partners.
""The pause on reciprocal tariffs announced by President Trump is a welcome reprieve for the global economy,"" Carney said in a post on X.
The pause on reciprocal tariffs announced by President Trump is a welcome reprieve for the global economy.As President Trump and I have agreed, the U.S. President and the Canadian Prime Minister will commence negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately…
The White House has released a statement calling on Congress to immediately ""pass the one, big, beautiful bill.""
It warned that if the budget resolution failed, Americans would ""be stuck with the largest tax hike in history.""
The statement claimed that the average taxpayer will see a ""22% tax hike"" if not passed.
President Donald Trump offered rare praise to Democrat Michigan Gov. Whitmer on Wednesday, as she appeared with him in Oval Office.
Trump praised the second-term governor as a ""very good person"" who has done an ""excellent job,"" while Whitmer stood next to the president as he signed executive orders.
Whitmer's office later said in a statement that she was ""surprised"" by the praise, and to be bought into the Oval Office. It also made clear that ""her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.""
The governor has been one of Trump's sharpest critics and even today, she delivered a speech that offered soft criticism of Trump, although emphasized their shared priorities.
However, Whitmer has now met with the president on several occasions, since he returned to office. Last month she said she was ""grateful"" to speak with Trump for a ""productive meeting"" that included discussions about jobs and tariffs.
President Trump has signed two executive orders targeting former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and his first term election security director Chris Krebs.
The orders revoke their security clearances and call for the Department of Justice to investigate their actions in government.
Trump's order accuses Krebs of being part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election after the election security director said that he was unable to find any evidence of the widespread voter fraud Trump had alleged.
It states Krebs, ""falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.""
Taylor, who served under multiple Republican administrations, wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed, and later a book, describing Trump's first term and the administration's alleged efforts to prevent the prevent the president was damaging the country.
In a section called, 'eradicating government betrayal', the order against Taylor claims he is a ""bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government position.""
The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, said that he wants to treat deporting immigrants like Amazon Prime deals with sending packages.
""We need to get better at treating this like a business,"" he said at the 2025 Border Security Expo, in Phoenix, according to the Arizona Mirror.
Lyons added that he wanted the deportation process to run ""like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings"".
He also said he hoped new technology, such as artificial intelligence, could speed up the deportation process to ""free up bed space"" and ""fill up airplanes.""
Lyons explained that ICE had been working with Elon Musk's DOGE to access Social Security numbers to try and track down alleged voter fraud.
President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he does not expect to have to raise the tariff on China again, after ratcheting up its levy to 125 percent.
Trump was speaking after he announced a 90-day pause on the tariff for every country aside from China.
Instead of pausing China's tariff, Trump announced he was raising it from 104 percent to 125 in the latest tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and the Asian nation. The move came after Beijing said it was raising its duty on American goods to 84%, following hikes from Trump.
Trump said today will likely be his last hike on China as he believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping will reach out to negotiate a deal.
""I can't imagine it,"" Trump said of having to raise the tariffs on China again. ""I don't think we'll have to do it more. No, I don't see that.""
President Donald Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, reacted to news that Trump has temporarily reversed course on initiating sweeping tariffs on numerous trading partners, calling the adjustment ""a win for the American people.""
In Trump's initial tariff announcement, which he dubbed ""Liberation Day"" for the U.S., he singled out about 60 countries, including some of the U.S.'s top trading partners, for what he described as ""discounted reciprocal tariffs"" above 10 percent. The president said those countries would face higher tariffs because he believes they engage in unfair trade practices.
He reversed that on Wednesday but continued to target China, stating that he was increasing the import tariff rate to 125 percent.
Reacting to the moves on Wednesday, Pence posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying, ""I am grateful that President Trump has committed to embracing a pause on many of the broad-based tariffs that were imposed on our trading partners around the world. When America trades with allies, it's a win for the American people.""
I am grateful that President Trump has committed to embracing a pause on many of the broad-based tariffs that were imposed on our trading partners around the world. When America trades with allies, it’s a win for the American people. Our goal should be free trade with free…
Republicans are responding to President Donald Trump's sudden decision to pause most reciprocal tariffs just hours after they took effect Wednesday, marking the latest development in his ever-changing trade policy.
A growing number of House and Senate Republicans have criticized President Donald Trump's trade policies and the unilateral manner in which they were enacted. Republican lawmakers in both chambers have introduced legislation aimed at curbing the president's authority to impose tariffs.
Since Trump announced a series of sweeping global tariffs in early April, including a baseline 10 percent on all imported goods and the widely anticipated ""reciprocal"" tariffs, the stock markets have experienced instability, with Wall Street posting its worst losses since 2020 and trillions of dollars in value erased.
Dozens of ""reciprocal"" tariffs took effect early Wednesday, but by the afternoon, President Donald Trump announced a pause on most of them. Since then, the stock market has surged.
Read in full from Mandy Taheri on Newsweek. 
The U.S. stock market has closed with a record-breaking bounce back after Trump announced he was pausing his retaliatory tariffs on almost every country.
The S&P 500′s 9.52% one-day gain is the third biggest since World War II, according to CNBC.
Dow Jones Industrial Average also had a huge, 7.87 percent jump, or 2,962.86 points - its biggest advance since March 2020.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to remove limitations on water pressure from shower heads and household appliances, an issue he frequently talked about on the campaign trail.
""@POTUS signs an Executive Order to end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure and Make America's Showers Great Again,"" a post from the Rapid Response 47 account posted on X, formerly Twitter.

President Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday;
""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.
At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.
Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""
President Donald Trump said that he intends to make ""fair deals for everybody"" on tariffs after announcing a 90-day pause on the duties for everyone except for China.
Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he ""just want[s] fair"" deals after he repeated his claims that United States were being ""ripped off"" by other countries.
""There will be fair deals. I just want fair,"" he said. ""They will be fair deals for everybody. But they weren't fair to the United States. They were sucking us dry.
""And people took advantage of our country, and they ripped us off ... for decades. I've been thinking about this for decades,"" he added.
FBI Director Kash Patel was quietly replaced as acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in late February, according to sources familiar with the matter. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has taken over the role, though the change was not publicly disclosed until recently. Patel, who had been sworn in as FBI director days before taking on the ATF role, still appears as the acting director on the ATF's website and in an April 7 press release.
The reasons for Patel's removal have not been made clear, and the change was only communicated to senior ATF officials on Wednesday. Driscoll, who will remain Army secretary, is also known for his brief tenure in the Army and his run in the 2020 Republican primary for a North Carolina congressional seat.
The Justice Department is considering a plan to merge the ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), both of which often collaborate but have distinct missions. The consolidation aims to improve efficiency and streamline operations between the two agencies.
Chief KPMG economist Diane Swonk shared her frustration over the rapidly changing tariffs and economic outlook after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the duties.
""This is nuts,"" Swonk told the New York Times on Wednesday shortly after the White House flip flop.
""Damage done. Market relief is a headfake, unless the administration makes a major course correction,"" she added.
She warned that even with relief of a tariffs pause, the rapid, chaotic changes to the tariffs were imposing harm on the markets on their own.
""Uncertainty is its own tax on the economy,"" she said.
Trump commented on market conditions Wednesday, stating that the bond market was ""beautiful"" despite recent volatility. He acknowledged that recent market trends had been ""pretty glum"" and saw signs of concern, particularly in the bond market on Tuesday.
Trump defended his decision to impose tariffs, saying that the trade situation with U.S. partners was unsustainable and that someone needed to act. ""I was willing to pull the trigger,"" he explained.
While acknowledging the impact of the tariffs on certain companies, the president indicated he would consider exemptions for those particularly affected, relying on ""instinct"" rather than a structured process to determine who would be exempt.
Just over an hour after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters outside the White House that the decision to reverse the tariffs had been Donald Trump's strategy ""all along,"" the president himself has come out and said that he made the decision in reaction to the markets panic.
""Over the last few days, it looked pretty glum,"" Trump said referring to the spiraling global stock markets.
He added that people were also ""getting a little bit yippy.""
""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,"" the president said when a reporter asked him to elaborate on his decision-making. ""They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid ... because we have a big job to do.""
A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, allowing Trump's administration to continue firing thousands of probationary federal workers. The decision overturned a lower court ruling that had required their reinstatement, supporting Trump's efforts to downsize the federal workforce.
The court's split panel, with Republican-appointed judges in favor, suggested that firings should be challenged through employment processes rather than federal court. This follows a similar ruling from the Supreme Court siding with the administration in a separate case.
The lawsuit, filed by 22 states, argues that the firings create financial burdens. Since Trump took office, about 24,000 probationary workers have been dismissed, though 15,000 have been reinstated or given paid leave. The states may seek further legal action as the case progresses.
President Donald Trump explained his decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, telling reporters at the White House that people were ""getting a little bit yippy.""
""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,"" the president said when a reporter asked him to elaborate on his decision-making. ""They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid ... because we have a big job to do.""
Trump abruptly announced earlier in the afternoon that he would pause most reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and increase tariffs on China to 125 percent after Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.
Read in full from Sonam Sheth on Newsweek. 
An assistant professor at Cornell University specializing in applied economics and policy, Wendy Zhang, has cautioned that the 125% tariff on Chinese goods could have significant consequences for the U.S. economy.
Zhang pointed out, per The New York Times, that a large percentage of key imports to the U.S. come from China, including 73% of smartphones, 78% of laptops, 87% of video game consoles, and 77% of toys. He also noted that a considerable amount of antibiotics used in U.S. livestock production are sourced from China. Zhang emphasized that while alternative suppliers could be found, the transition would take time and likely result in higher costs for U.S. consumers.
President Donald Trump announced a temporary 90-day pause on his administration's broad tariff scheme for more than 75 countries — but excluding China, which he accused of showing ""disrespect"" to global markets.
Instead, effective immediately, the president said tariffs on Chinese imports will rise to 125 percent, deepening the trade rift between the world's two largest economies.
Amid a global market meltdown, Trump reversed course by pausing most of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. trade partners, while sharply increasing the tariff rate on Chinese imports to 125 percent.
Global markets surged on the news, which was delivered via a Truth Social post around 1:30 p.m. ET.

As financial markets reel from a new round of tariffs and bond sell-offs, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning that credit problems are mounting and corporate loan defaults may soon follow.
In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Dimon said rising interest rates, sticky inflation, and widening credit spreads are setting the stage for a wave of financial strain among U.S. companies.
Dimon's warning coincides with major turbulence in global bond markets and intensified fears of recession.
JPMorgan economists recently raised their forecast for a U.S. and global recession to 60 percent, up from 40 percent following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including 104 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.

Shares of General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis saw notable gains, with GM rising 5.7%, Ford up 5.6%, and Stellantis increasing by 11.9%. Despite the increase, all three companies are still down for the year as tariffs on imported goods continue to affect production costs and drive up consumer prices. These manufacturers, with supply chains and production facilities across North America, are facing higher costs as a result of the tariffs.
Tesla, which rose 14.1%, is less impacted by the tariffs due to its vehicles being assembled in the U.S. However, the company has faced scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk's collaboration with President Trump to reduce government spending, and Tesla's stock is down 40% since Trump's inauguration.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed concerns over recent market turmoil, attributing the volatility to a misunderstanding of President Donald Trump's tariff strategy. Speaking at the White House, Bessent explained that the high tariff levels were meant to serve as a starting point for negotiations, allowing countries to lower tariffs and trade barriers by engaging with the U.S.
Bessent emphasized that Trump's approach created maximum negotiating leverage, and he argued that China, in particular, had revealed itself as a problematic actor on the global stage. His remarks came as markets began to stabilize following initial uncertainty about the administration's trade tactics.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has launched an audit of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to investigate its handling of data at several federal agencies. The audit, which began in March, focuses on the Department of Labor, Education, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and the Social Security Administration, as well as the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), according to Wired.
The GAO has requested extensive records from these agencies, including documentation on potential misuse of agency systems and data, policies related to data protection, and audit logs for any access granted to DOGE operatives. Concerns have been raised about DOGE operatives, many with ties to Musk's companies, gaining access to sensitive government data without adequate oversight or experience.
The audit, initiated at the request of congressional leaders, will specifically examine whether DOGE adheres to privacy and data protection laws. The GAO's final report, expected by the end of spring, will include findings on DOGE's data handling practices. Some Democratic officials have raised alarms about the department's potential to compromise the privacy and security of American citizens' personal data.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed concerns surrounding Trump's decision to impose tariffs, calling them a strategic negotiation tool. During a briefing outside the White House with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Leavitt remarked that many reporters failed to understand the logic behind Trump's approach, referencing his book The Art of the Deal.
Leavitt also pushed back against the notion that the tariffs would push U.S. allies into China's sphere of influence. ""In fact, we've seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China,"" she stated. ""They need our markets, they need our consumers, and they need this president in the Oval Office.""
She further claimed that over 75 countries had contacted the U.S. to begin discussions. The retaliatory tariffs on goods from China and other countries came into effect just after midnight.
Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. would raise tariffs on China to 125%, effective immediately.
He also authorized a 90-day pause in tariffs for more than 75 other countries, setting the rate at 10% during this period.
Delta Air Lines withdrew its 2025 performance forecast on Wednesday, citing disruptions in global trade and rising uncertainty. The airline had expected a record financial year as recently as January.
The move marks a sharp reversal for the nation's most profitable airline. Delta also plans to scale back its flight schedule, anticipating a drop in spending from both businesses and consumers facing higher prices.
Shortly after Delta's announcement, Walmart also retracted its first-quarter profit guidance, pointing to tariff-related risks.
House Democrats raised alarms Wednesday over the national security effects of President Trump's new tariffs, warning they may drive key Pacific allies closer to China.
At a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Rep. Joe Courtney pointed to a recent economic meeting between Japan, South Korea, and China as a sign of shifting alliances. ""This is driving our allies in the wrong direction,"" he said.
Defense official John Noh declined to comment directly on the tariffs, prompting frustration from Democrats. Rep. Adam Smith said the U.S. had ""launched a trade war against every single one of our partners in the Asia region.""
Shares of pharmaceutical companies dropped worldwide on Wednesday after President Trump repeated his intention to impose tariffs on imported medications. While most drug products were exempt from the latest round of tariffs that took effect the same day, Trump's continued push has raised industry concerns.
The president has argued that taxing foreign-made drugs will boost domestic production. However, experts warn the move could drive up prices and lead to shortages, especially for generic medications heavily reliant on overseas manufacturing.
Social media star MrBeast criticized Trump's tariff policy on Tuesday, saying it makes it more expensive to produce his chocolate bars in the United States. In a post on X, he said that due to the new tariffs, it's now ""way cheaper"" to make his globally sold products outside of America.
In a follow-up post, MrBeast warned that tariffs could be the ""nail in the coffin"" for small businesses, echoing concerns from other entrepreneurs facing rising costs tied to the ongoing trade war.
Ironically because of all the new tariffs it is now way cheaper to make our chocolate bars we sell globally NOT in America because other countries don’t have a 20%+ tariff on our cogs 😅
Btw we pay our farmers a living income, use fair trade certified beans, etc. so I was already spending a lot on cocoa. A random price hike was pretty brutal ngl. We’ll figure it out. I feel for small businesses though. Could really be a nail in the coffin for them.
European companies are looking beyond the United States for trade opportunities as President Donald Trump's aggressive new tariff regime sparks fresh uncertainty in global trade.
The shift by European companies away from U.S. markets could have far-reaching consequences for the American economy. As key foreign investors and trading partners reconsider their presence, the U.S. risks losing access to critical goods, capital, and innovation. This could slow job growth, disrupt supply chains, and increase prices for consumers—all while weakening the U.S.'s influence in global markets.
On April 2, the White House announced a 10 percent baseline tariff on all imports, with higher rates on countries running trade surpluses—including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the EU, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan. Mexico and Canada, which were exempt from the new tariffs, still face a previous 25 percent levy.
Trump's announcement immediately sent the markets into turmoil on April 3, with Wall Street recording its worst day since 2020—when COVID-19 was in full swing. However, U.S. stocks ticked back up on Tuesday.
Amid the uncertainty, European companies are eyeing an opportunity to pivot away from the U.S. market to avoid the effects of the tariffs.
On Thursday, during a meeting at the Elysée Palace with representatives of sectors affected by the tariffs, French President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted EU businesses to stop investing in the U.S.
""It is important that future investments, the investments announced over the last few weeks, should be put on hold for some time until we have clarified things with the United States of America,"" Macron said.

The European Chamber of Commerce in China has stated that the latest U.S. tariffs will force many companies to rethink their business models and supply chains. The chamber predicts that these changes will lead to higher operational costs, inefficiencies, and ultimately, increased prices for consumers.
Companies that currently produce goods in China for export to the U.S. may need to explore alternative markets or even relocate production outside of China to maintain access to the U.S. market. The new tariffs and China's countermeasures will also negatively affect foreign-invested enterprises in China that rely on U.S. components for their production. If these companies cannot find alternative suppliers, they may be forced to move their production out of China altogether.
Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and sources familiar with the situation. The cancellations, which affect items such as beach chairs, scooters, and air conditioners, appear to be a response to President Donald Trump's tariffs announced on April 2. These tariffs target goods from more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam, and Thailand.
Vendors impacted by the cancellations suspect the move was triggered by the trade dispute. One vendor, who has sold beach chairs to Amazon for over a decade, reported that a $500,000 order was canceled after the chairs were already produced, leaving the vendor with additional financial responsibility. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the cancellations, but the company has noted in its annual report that international trade disputes, including tariffs, pose a risk to its business.
The precise extent of the cancellations and the specific products affected remain unclear. Amazon's move to cancel orders could shift tariff exposure back to the vendors, who may face higher costs if they import goods through other means. While Amazon directly imports about 40% of its products, the rest are sold by independent merchants on its platform.
This decision follows broader concerns over the economic impact of the trade war. As businesses face rising costs due to tariffs, analysts have warned of potential recession risks. In light of these developments, Robert W. Baird & Co. reduced its 2025 revenue forecast for Amazon, which has seen its stock drop 21% this year.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reiterated concerns about China's increasing presence in the western hemisphere during a regional security conference in Panama City on Wednesday. Hegseth, who previously described China as a threat to the Panama Canal, emphasized that Chinese companies were controlling key infrastructure in the region, raising security concerns.
Hegseth pointed out that China's military has an extensive presence in the area, adding that Beijing's investments in the region are aimed at gaining military advantage and securing economic benefits. He urged governments in the Americas to collaborate on addressing these threats, alongside other issues such as transnational drug cartels and mass immigration.
Beijing has issued a travel advisory urging its citizens to assess the risks of visiting the United States and to exercise caution while traveling, the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism said.
This comes in the wake of China's decision to raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, further escalating the ongoing trade war between the two nations.
Today on CNN This Morning, Derek Thompson, staff writer at The Atlantic and co-author of Abundance, joined anchor Audie Cornish to discuss President Trump's new tariffs. Thompson expressed concern over the chaos caused by Trump's trade policies and suggested that the ""capital class"" should intervene to oppose them. He argued that the U.S. needs corporate leaders to speak out against Trump's tariff strategy, emphasizing that such policies would not effectively reindustrialize America. Instead, Thompson pointed to Joe Biden's successful Chips and Science Act, which helped stimulate semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.
Thompson further criticized Trump's approach, noting that raising tariffs on materials like lumber and drywall would only drive up housing costs and exacerbate shortages, rather than solving the underlying issues. In contrast, his Abundance ideology promotes reducing regulations and removing bottlenecks in housing construction. Thompson believes that certainty, not unpredictability, is key to fostering growth and manufacturing, a point that Trump's erratic tariff policies fail to provide.
Thompson also weighed in on Bernie Sanders' criticisms of the oligarchy, urging corporate leaders to step up against the president's chaotic economic policies to ensure stable growth.
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc is set to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington, DC, on Wednesday. The meeting comes as the Trump administration continues negotiations with several countries over the president's tariffs, CNN reported.
Bessent has also been engaged in talks with officials from Japan, South Korea, and other nations. Under the new tariff regime unveiled by the Trump administration last week, Vietnam faces some of the highest ""reciprocal"" tariff rates, with a 46% tariff taking effect today.
The United States has reinforced its air power in the Western Pacific Ocean with two groups of fighter jets arriving at Kadena Air Base in Japan, staging a show of force to China.
Newsweek has emailed both the Chinese defense and foreign ministries for comment.
Kadena is located on the Japanese island of Okinawa and is the closest American air base to Taiwan, a U.S. security partner. Communist China has long claimed the self-governed island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force, if necessary, to achieve unification.
Japan is part of the First Island Chain, a U.S. maritime containment strategy that seeks to restrict the Chinese military's access to the Western Pacific Ocean.

On CNN's Early Start, Capital Economics' Group Chief Economist Neil Shearing shared his insights on the global economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, which have escalated tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners.
Shearing emphasized that there are no true winners in a tariff war, as higher prices harm consumers and disrupt global supply chains. He noted that U.S. consumers and Chinese producers are likely to bear the brunt of the damage, with tariffs on China expected to be steeper than those imposed on other countries. However, some countries may benefit by taking advantage of the shifting production, with companies like Apple potentially moving some production to India.
Shearing also addressed the U.S. Federal Reserve's role amid the economic uncertainty. He explained that while President Trump has called for interest rate cuts, the Fed faces a dilemma. The rising tariffs are likely to push inflation higher, making it difficult for the Fed to reduce rates without risking further inflationary pressures.
In conclusion, Shearing stated that the ongoing trade conflicts are tightening financial conditions, which could negatively affect consumers and businesses in the real economy.
U.S. stock indexes are showing significant fluctuations in early trading. The S&P 500 inched slightly higher, while the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with tech stocks, also saw a modest gain.
However, the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies more sensitive to the economy's health, is down. This mixed performance reflects investor uncertainty amid ongoing economic concerns.
Walmart is sticking to its full-year sales and operating income forecast, even as President Trump's trade wars with China and other trading partners intensify. The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, confirmed Wednesday that it expects first-quarter sales growth between 3% and 4%.
However, it withdrew its previous guidance for first-quarter operating profit growth, citing the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Walmart emphasized its need for flexibility to adjust pricing as tariffs are implemented. The company has mitigated some tariff risks by sourcing two-thirds of its merchandise domestically, with groceries accounting for 60% of its U.S. business.
Republican senators are voicing growing concerns about the economic fallout from =Trump's sweeping tariff policy, which took effect on Wednesday. Manufacturers are struggling with long-term planning, farmers are facing retaliation from Chinese buyers, and U.S. households are burdened with rising prices.
During a Senate hearing and in interviews, GOP lawmakers expressed skepticism about the administration's approach, directing much of their concern at U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. This rare dissent comes as the stock market shows signs of volatility, and economists warn the tariffs could trigger a recession.
EU Member States have voted in favor of the European Commission's proposal to implement trade countermeasures against the United States. This response comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU in March.
The EU views these tariffs as unjustified and harmful, affecting both economies and the global market. The Commission has emphasized its desire to reach a negotiated, balanced solution with the U.S. The countermeasures will come into effect on April 15, following the completion of the Commission's internal procedures.
However, the EU has said that these measures can be suspended if the U.S. agrees to a fair negotiation.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is set to meet with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, following a speech she will give in Washington about the economy.
According to a spokesperson, Whitmer's visit to the White House is part of her continued efforts to engage with the Trump administration despite policy differences, The Associated Press reported.
Whitmer, one of a few Democratic governors who has discussed the possibility of working with the Republican president, previously met with Trump last month.
The Department of Education has claimed immunity from a lawsuit taken by students trying to stop massive federal cuts.
The students are trying to stop the Department of Education from sharing student loan information with the Department of Government Efficiency and its director, Elon Musk.
If the Department of Education succeeds in obtaining immunity from DOGE lawsuits, other Trump administration departments would likely claim the same immunity.
Musk would then be able to continue with his plan to cut the federal budget by up to $2 trillion a year.
Newsweek sought email comment from the Department of Education and the Department of Government Efficiency.

The White House announced on Tuesday that more than $1 billion in federal funding for Cornell University and around $790 million for Northwestern University have been frozen as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged civil rights violations at the schools. This move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to use government funding to enforce its political agenda in academic institutions.
Both universities have expressed concern over the funding freezes. Cornell revealed that it had received more than 75 stop work orders related to national defense and cybersecurity research but had not been formally notified about the $1 billion in frozen grants. Northwestern also stated that it had not received any official notice but warned that the funding cuts could disrupt crucial research, including projects focused on healthcare and technology.
The funding pauses come after the U.S. Department of Education warned universities, including Cornell and Northwestern, about potential enforcement actions related to antisemitism on campuses during protests last year. This is part of the administration's broader strategy to ensure universities comply with federal law regarding protections for Jewish students.
The funding freezes have raised concerns about the impact on vital research at these universities, with critics arguing that the administration's approach could harm scientific progress without addressing the core issue of campus antisemitism.
In a recent interview, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent how far the U.S. is willing to go in its ongoing trade tensions with China, particularly regarding Chinese stocks on U.S. exchanges.
Bessent responded, ""I think everything's on the table.""

Trump confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. will soon impose new tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, although he did not specify a timeline.
Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, Trump expressed frustration over the high cost of pharmaceuticals in the U.S., citing that they can be ""10 times more"" expensive than in other countries.
""We're going to do something that we have to do — we're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals,"" Trump said, adding that the move would lead to pharmaceuticals ""rushing back into our country.""
He promised that details of the new tariff announcement would come ""very shortly.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the U.S. has no plans to back down after China retaliated once again against President Trump's tariffs. In an appearance on Fox Business, Bessent pointed out China's significant trade surplus, stating, ""Their exports to the U.S. are five times our exports to China. So, they can raise their tariff, but so what?""
While reaffirming the U.S. stance, Bessent also suggested a potential diplomatic path forward, proposing that China could help mitigate tensions by acknowledging its role in the fentanyl trade. ""What would be a very good step with the Chinese would be acknowledging that the precursor chemicals for fentanyl come from China,"" he said. ""They make their way into North America, and then are sold into the U.S.""
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced Wednesday that he is sending a delegation to the United States to hold talks with the Trump administration regarding the 29% tariffs imposed on Pakistani imports, The Associated Press reported.
The delegation, which will include prominent business leaders and key exporters, is tasked with discussing ways to enhance exports and addressing the impact of the tariffs on Pakistan's economy. The decision came after a high-level meeting in Islamabad, where Sharif and officials reviewed the potential economic repercussions of the U.S. tariffs.
With Pakistan's economy heavily dependent on foreign loans, a decline in exports could exacerbate its already fragile financial situation.
The Trump administration has reversed many of its recent emergency food aid cuts after backlash from humanitarian groups and lawmakers—but funding remains frozen in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world's most vulnerable countries. Officials confirmed Wednesday that the administration walked back some of the terminations after the World Food Program and others raised alarms about the impact on millions of lives.
USAID, which had initially slashed funding to 14 countries, notified WFP on Tuesday of the partial reversal. The shift comes after reports that the cuts were ordered by Jeremy Lewin, a close ally of Elon Musk, who now oversees USAID under Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
The situation remains especially dire in Afghanistan and Yemen. In Afghanistan, where over 23 million people rely on aid, the cuts will end food support for millions, halt care for malnourished children, and disrupt maternal health services. In Yemen, 2.4 million people will lose access to food aid, with additional programs for displaced and disabled individuals at risk.
The U.S. had been the top donor to the World Food Program, giving nearly half of its $9.8 billion in funding last year. But the Trump administration has repeatedly criticized foreign aid as wasteful and accused agencies like USAID of pursuing political agendas.
It remains unclear how many of the original 14 country programs will see funding restored, but officials say behind-the-scenes lobbying by U.N. representatives played a key role in reversing some of the decisions.
China said it will hike its tariff on U.S. imports to 84 percent after President Donald Trump increased tariffs again on Chinese goods, in a trade war that continues to escalate.
This is an additional 50 percent to the current rate. It follows Trump's raising of the tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent as of Wednesday.
""The US escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system,"" China's finance ministry said in a statement.
Trump had warned China on Monday to withdraw its retaliatory tariff of 34 percent by Tuesday or face an additional 50 percent U.S. tariff on Wednesday.
The deadline passed and the new U.S. tariff rate for Chinese imports came into effect.

EXCLUSIVE: Biden administration State Department officials held private talks with Beijing counterparts about the Chinese spy balloon that intercepted U.S. airspace in 2023, and discussed the implications the balloon's publicity would have on the relationship between the U.S. and China, according to Trump administration officials. 
U.S. officials identified the spy balloon infiltrating U.S. airspace on Jan. 28, 2023, and an Air Force fighter jet shot down the Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina Feb. 4, 2023, two days after the Pentagon issued a statement on the matter.  
Biden officials held discussions with Beijing Feb. 1, 2023, about the balloon, and discussed the impact disclosing the balloon to the public could have on the relationship with China, internal State Department documents show, two Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital.

An internal State Department readout of the talks between Blinken and a top Chinese diplomat said Blinken stated that if the presence of the balloon were revealed publicly, it could have ""profound implications for our relationship"" with China, particularly amid efforts to stabilize the bilateral relationship with Beijing, two Trump administration officials familiar with the documents told Fox News Digital. 
The readout said that the incident could also have complicated Blinken’s travel plans to China in early February 2023, if not quickly resolved. Blinken ultimately postponed the trip until June 2023. 
A former Biden administration official told Fox News Digital that the State Department summoned senior Chinese diplomat Zhu Haiquan Feb. 1, 2023, so that the U.S. could notify China to remove the balloon, and issue a warning that the U.S. could take action to eliminate the balloon. 
""Former Secretary Blinken advocated strongly to tell the American people about China’s rogue balloon, which is exactly what happened,"" a spokesperson for the former secretary of state said in a Tuesday statement to Fox News Digital. ""He has a long history of being tough on China while actually delivering results.""
Likewise, another senior State Department official also held private talks on Feb. 1, 2023, with Chinese counterparts. A readout from that discussion says that the official claimed the longer it took to mitigate the issue would only increase the likelihood that news of the balloon would become public, posing greater challenges managing the situation, the Trump administration officials said. 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO … THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CHINESE SPY BALLOON

Ultimately, the Pentagon issued a statement Feb. 2, 2023, claiming that the U.S. government had detected a ""high-altitude surveillance balloon."" 
While then-White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden received a briefing on the balloon on Jan. 31, 2023, she did not provide details regarding why his administration didn’t issue a statement on the matter until Feb. 2, 2023. 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, then a U.S. senator from Florida, repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for how it handled disclosing information to the public about the balloon — and how long it took the administration to shoot it down. 
Biden’s failure to address the situation sooner was the ""beginning of dereliction of duty,"" Rubio said during an appearance on CNN with Jake Tapper. 
""Why didn’t the president go on television?"" Rubio told Tapper. ""He has the ability to convene the country in cameras and basically explain what we’re dealing with here.""

On Feb. 4, 2023, an Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter jet from Virginia's Langley Air Force Base shot down the balloon off the coast of South Carolina with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile. 
At the time, the Pentagon said that while the balloon was not a military or physical threat, its presence in U.S. airspace did violate U.S. sovereignty. The Pentagon also shut down China’s initial claims that the balloon was a weather balloon blown off course and labeled such statements false. 
""This was a PRC surveillance balloon,"" a senior defense official told reporters at the time. ""This surveillance balloon purposely traversed the United States and Canada, and we are confident it was seeking to monitor sensitive military sites.""
The Pentagon also said after shooting down the balloon that similar balloons from China transited continental U.S. airspace in at least three instances during Trump’s first administration.

Additionally, Biden ""gave his authorization to take down the Chinese surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to us civilians under the balloon's path,"" the senior defense official said, noting that there was concern debris could harm civilians. 
The Pentagon later said in June 2023 that it did not believe that the balloon gathered information as it traveled across the U.S.

European Union member states have voted to impose tariffs on a list of U.S. goods in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on the bloc.
Newsweek has contacted the EU for a full list of U.S. goods it plans to hit with new trade taxes.
Trump hit EU imports with a 20 percent tariff on April 2, claiming the EU already had tariff measures against the U.S. that equated to 39 percent. This came after he imposed 25 percent tariffs on auto imports, as well as aluminum and steel.
On Monday, Trump rejected an EU offer for a ""zero-for-zero"" tariff goods deal, setting the stage for these countermeasures to be debated. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would retaliate if the U.S. did not accept the deal. Trump said the EU would have to commit to buying $350 billion of American energy to get respite from his tariffs.
Tariffs affect global supply chains and could increase prices on both sides of the exchange. So far, only China and Canada have imposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., with Trump upping tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%, raising concerns about a global trade war which could push countries into recession.
The 27 EU member states voted on a list which targets €21 billion worth of goods with 25 percent import tariffs.
The Commission said in a statement after Wednesdays vote that the EU ""considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy.""
""The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the US, which would be balanced and mutually beneficial,"" it continued.
""These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome.""
According to Reuters, which first reported on the list, goods included on the list range from meat, toiletries, vacuum cleaners, wood and clothing. Newsweek has not independently obtained the list and has contacted the EU by email to comment on this story.
Bourbon and wine were originally on the list until France, Italy and Ireland questioned their inclusion, expressing concern that they would damage the drinks industry.
But some experts have suggested the EU's real weapon against tariffs could exist away from goods and in services, potentially hitting America's tech giants and financial institutions
The U.S. is the world's largest exporter of services—including digital, banking and tourism—with a trade surplus of nearly $300 billion last year. The EU's never-yet-used so-called ""anti-coercion instrument"" could cut banks off from projects worth some $2.2 trillion a year, the New York Times reported.
However, Trump warned in his April 2 executive order, announcing the new tariffs, that if ""any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [tariffs] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.""
Speaking to Newsweek, Scott Lucas, a professor in international politics at University College Dublin, said the tariffs will cause ""some level of response from the United States."" He added that the EU can't let the Trump administration act like ""bullies"" and not respond to their tariffs but the EU should ""calibrate it to try limit the effect on European consumers, manufacturers and farmers.""
Ursula Von der Leyen said before the vote the EU is, ""now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail,"" after the U.S. imposed a 20 percent tariff on EU imports.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump said: ""The European Union's been very bad to us; they don't take our cars, like Japan in that sense, they don't take our agricultural products, they don't take anything practically, yet they send millions of cars a year, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMWs, they're sending millions and millions of cars into the U.S.
""We have a deficit with the European Union of $350 billion and it's going to disappear fast, and one of the ways that that can disappear easily and quickly is they're going to have to buy our energy from us because they need it.""
The first set of EU tariffs will take effect on April 15 and a second will come into effect on May 16.
The full list of U.S. goods on the EU's tariff list is not expected to be released until next week.

With his extreme new round of tariffs in effect as of Wednesday morning, President Trump’s trade war is at full throttle. Stock markets around the world keep plummeting, and chaos and uncertainty are the order of the day. but in order to gain a modicum clarity into the situation, I spoke with Olu Sonola, the U.S. Head of Economic Research at Fitch Ratings. We discussed why the trade war as it stands is untenable, what a trade war with only China might look like, and one sign that a recession might be near.

Markets rebounded sharply on Tuesday morning, seemingly because of a few comments by Trump administration officials who said other countries want to make bilateral trade deals with the U.S. Then stocks fell back down again. It may be foolish to try to divine what the market’s doing hour by hour, but what did you make of those developments?

﻿I try to stay away from market ups and downs and stay in the economics lane as much as possible, but what I can say is that clearly the volatility is expected. Particularly because literally every minute now is “breaking news,” and markets are primed to react to it every time it pops up. Clearly, market direction is basically hinged on any news at all on the trade front.

Looking at the big picture, which is what I tend to focus on, at some point you hope an off-ramp is taken. It has to be taken; it’s just a question of when. We have to have a conversation — and by “we,” I mean the U.S. government — that is reasonable. I think ultimately where that would end up is that reciprocal tariffs will move lower. It’s a question of when that signal will come. Are we talking about days? Are we talking about weeks?

You frame it as this has to happen because if it doesn’t happen — calamity?

﻿Yeah, because you can’t fight a trade war with the entire world. You just can’t. You can select a few countries and have this sort of tension, but you can’t with the entire world.

What if there’s a scenario — and this seems fairly likely — in which some countries, like, say, Japan and South Korea, get much more favorable terms than other major trading partners? Trump hates the E.U., for instance, and could punish it more than others.

﻿Coming in, I always thought that was going to be the outcome, that some countries would be singled out and others would get very preferential rates. There may end up being a full-blown trade war with China, but I think the U.S. will still be somewhat reluctant with the E.U., just given deep relationships that go back. The tariff rate on them is 20 percent, which is below average. That suggests we still look at the E.U. as a relatively favorable partner from a trade standpoint, which may also suggest that it may not take much for us to come to some sort of compromise with the E.U. — unlike with China, where we’re really far apart. They’ve also levied a retaliation rate, and it looks like it’s just going to escalate before they de-escalate.

But still, the notion that every country has to negotiate separately like this, just the uncertainty embedded in that assumption — how does that affect the overall economic picture?

﻿Uncertainty is bad for business. It’s just that simple. Even if you get clarity on three or four countries and your uncertainty persists for many other countries we have major trading businesses with, you are going to see that likely cascade through investments, through hiring, because you don’t know what to do.

If you also have existing tariffs in place, even just from China, you also would be wondering, Do I place that order now? Am I going to pay 100 percent when it shows up? What if that tariff rate goes away in two months? So I’m not going to be left holding that bag? Am I going to get a refund on my 100 percent? So you’d rather just sit on your hands, do nothing, and not invest. And if you’re not really doing anything, to what extent does that cascade to jobs?

We import a lot of inputs from China — a lot of intermediate inputs, a lot of capital goods. Most of it goes straight into the manufacturing process. Does that slow down manufacturing in the U.S.? Does that cost jobs longer term? These are all uncertainties that immediately will be around because reshoring is going to take time — months, years. But the impact of uncertainty is here and now. When you think about the short term versus the long term, that’s what the stakes are. That is where the rubber meets the road.

Let’s say our other major trading partners make more favorable deals, or the U.S. just ratchets down the tariff rates on them, but we’re still in a serious trade war with China. How much would that alone affect the United States’s medium-term economic outlook?

﻿It’s negative without question. To quantify that, we’ll have to see how a few things go. Everybody knows that a lot of Chinese products come into the U.S. more or less tariff-free, or with much lower tariffs, through Vietnam, Cambodia, even Mexico. But if you narrow it down to just China, we imported $430 billion last year. And as I said earlier, a big chunk are inputs, intermediate goods, and capital goods. So I think that’s going to blow back.

The other point is prices, right? Some of it — probably the majority of it — will be passed along. But if you’re talking about a tariff rate in the range of 100 percent, where do you even start having the conversation? People are just not going to import. Then you’re not just talking about the price function; you’re not just talking about inflation. It’s really about to what extent those inputs will slow down manufacturing in the U.S., and that’s also going to be a negative. Yes, manufacturing in the U.S. is only 10 percent of GDP, and at the moment it accounts for only 8 percent of employment. And China is just one of many countries we get our inputs from. So to that extent, maybe if we still have growth in other places, if we still have a relatively strong economy, it will offset the weaknesses.

I have not quantified it yet because so much is uncertain. It also depends on — are we still going to go after Vietnam? Are we still going to go after Cambodia? If we’re saying, “Hey, absolutely nothing from China through those countries,” that’s an even bigger deal. If we’re not and everything just goes through other countries rather than coming straight from China to the U.S., then obviously that cushions the blow. But the U.S. will probably want to put things in place to avoid that. Really, there are so many things at play, and so many things to think about.

And of course the idea of reshoring is also affected by the kind of uncertainty you mentioned. If you don’t know whether these measures will stay in place, why go all in on anything?

﻿Exactly. The uncertainty is bad for business, particularly business investment. At some point, it’s going to start showing up in their employment numbers. I went back to the 1950s and looked at every single quarter of contraction we’ve had since then; when you look at that, the bulk of the contribution to those contractions, about 70 percent of it, came from business investment.

Business investment is only about 15 percent of the economy, but in terms of volatility, that’s what gets you. The only time we had a significant downturn with most of it coming from the U.S. consumer was COVID, and that was obvious. But once you take COVID out of it, probably 80-plus percent were all about the downdraft in business investment. So that will be an important thing to watch going forward.

With the United States observing National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day on April 9, Fox News anchor and former White House press secretary Dana Perino interviewed former White House speechwriter and historian Jonathan Horn about his newest book, ""The Fate of the Generals."" The book tells the true story of Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, the highest-ranking American POW of World War II.
– 
Dana Perino: Who was Gen. Jonathan Wainwright?
Jonathan Horn: Gen. Wainwright was a gritty cavalryman who grew up in Montana not far from the Little Bighorn battlefield — the site of one of history’s most famous last stands — but who could not have known that he would one day have to make a last stand of his own. It happened in the Philippines (then an American colony) during the early days of World War II, when the Japanese invaded the islands after attacking Pearl Harbor.  
US ARMY VETERAN STARTS SUCCESSFUL BARBECUE BUSINESS DESPITE HEALTH CHALLENGES: ‘VERY PROUD’
Wainwright became the top United States commander in the Philippines after his superior Douglas MacArthur received orders to flee the islands, even as his troops there fought on against impossible odds. While MacArthur vowed to return to the islands, Wainwright took a very different oath: to stay there and share the fate of his men, even if it meant surrendering with them and becoming the highest-ranking American prisoner of the Japanese.

Perino: Why does the United States observe National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day on April 9? 
Horn: It's the anniversary of the largest surrender of United States forces in history. When the Japanese landed in the Philippines in December 1941, American and Filipino troops fell back into the jungles of the Bataan peninsula, where they fought on without sufficient food or medicine until their bodies could fight on no longer. That sad day came on April 9, 1942.
Nearly 80,000 men lay down their arms. Those who survived the terrors of the Bataan Death March would find new horrors as prisoners of the Japanese. Wainwright would carry on the struggle for another month on a small island called Corregidor, a few miles off the tip of Bataan. He finally agreed to surrender himself and the rest of the Philippines only because he feared the Japanese would otherwise carry out a massacre.

Perino: What happened to Wainwright during his time as a prisoner of the Japanese?
Horn: Wainwright remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. The Japanese subjected him to what he called ""systematic starvation"" and beatings as they moved him from the Philippines to camps in Taiwan and eventually all the way to Manchuria.
GRANDSON OF FORMER COMMANDANT OF AUSCHWITZ ON RISE OF ANTISEMITISM, HIS LIFE AS A PASTOR
Perhaps the cruelest torture was isolation from the outside world. Receiving no letters for long periods and cut off from the news, Wainwright worried that the American people would never forgive him for the decision he had made to surrender for the sake of his men.

Perino: When Wainwright returned to America after the war, he received a hero’s welcome and the Medal of Honor. Why do you think so many Americans today are unfamiliar with his name?
Horn: The story of MacArthur's vow to return to the Philippines has overshadowed the story of Wainwright's vow to stay with his men there. More than four decades have passed since a biography about Wainwright last came out. 
During that time, boxes of Wainwright's personal papers, including his diaries and letters, have become available for research in military archives. As a result, it’s possible to tell his story now in a way never before possible and to restore him to his proper place in history.

Perino: What lesson do you hope Americans today will draw from Wainwright’s story?
Horn: I hope Americans today will remember the lesson Wainwright himself drew from his terrible ordeal: the need for military preparedness. I also hope they will never forget the courage he and his fellow prisoners of war showed and the sacrifice they made for our country.

Zack Peter, host of the popular pop culture podcast ""No Filter,"" has been following the downward spiral of ""Snow White"" from the beginning. 
Though some estimates from February predicted the film to make upwards of $85 million domestically in its opening weekend, ""Snow White"" opened in the U.S. and Canada to only $43 million in ticket sales. It then suffered a 66% drop at the box office in its second weekend. This past weekend, the new ""A Minecraft Movie"" opened with $163 million, while ""Snow White"" made just $6 million.
In Peter's opinion, star Rachel Zegler is largely to blame for the movie's collapse. In the months leading up to the ""Snow White"" premiere, Zegler's outspoken politics gave her and the upcoming movie some unwanted attention. She posted the message, ""Free Palestine,"" on X, and in another post on Instagram she wished that Donald Trump supporters ""never know peace."" She would later apologize for the latter comment, but not before some damage had already been done.
‘SNOW WHITE’ STAR RACHEL ZEGLER APOLOGIZES FOR PROFANE POST WISHING TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘HAVE NO PEACE’
""Snow White"" lead actress Rachel Zegler's political outbursts contributed to the ""perfect storm"" of bad press that led to the movie's box office bombing, film experts told Fox News Digital. (Valerie Macon/Contributor)
""I know people try to argue that like Gal Gadot and, you know, the other people were part of the criticism, but I feel like Rachel Zegler was very much at the center of it,"" Peter told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. ""She was very polarizing. She told people, you know, if they didn't vote for Kamala Harris, she didn't want their support. And I think they heard that message loud and clear. And so they didn't want to come and support her."" 
""And I think what, you know, somebody like Rachel Zegler, and I know she's young, but I think what she fails to realize is it's like, even if she does want to polarize her audience and there's a fraction of the community that she doesn't want supporting her, those are still people that have kids and their families, and they're going to want to take their kids to be part of the magic that is Disney,"" he continued. ""And I feel like she definitely lost that message and turned a lot of people off.""
""I mean, the fact that she attached the promo of the trailer for Snow White with her free Palestine comment, Disney very much doesn't like to get political at all,"" he added. ""They want to make sure that the magic of Disney is a welcoming community for everyone. So, I mean, I know a lot of people want to give her a pass, but I think a big part of why the movie bombed was because she's the face of the film.""

Peter suggested though that Disney was partly at fault for not ""training"" Zegler enough for her press tour.
""And maybe that's Disney's part. Disney's failure to not prepare her for, you know, media training enough, but I just feel like at some point we need to hold her accountable to, like, at least understand how, if you're going to want to pursue a career in Hollywood, and you're going to want to attach yourself to a big brand like Disney, you're going to kind of have to play by their rules if they're paying you millions of dollars to be part of this film.""
Jonah Platt, son of ""Snow White"" producer Marc Platt, claimed in a now-deleted Instagram comment that his dad was forced to take time away from his family to deal with the Zegler fallout. 
""Yeah, my dad, the producer of [an] enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to fly across the country to reprimand his 20-year-old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for,"" he wrote.

Peter regretted that Disney, as of late, appeared to be straying from the classic love story formula. The live-action ""Snow White"" removed the song in which she sings about finding her true love and instead largely focuses on her quest to become a leader. Zegler even disparaged the original plot of the movie as backwards at the 2022 D23 Expo. 
""I just mean that it's no longer 1937,"" she told Variety. ""She's not going to be saved by the prince, and she's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.""
""I don't know why it's so controversial to have a love story now, you know?"" Peter mused to Fox News Digital. ""Like, I just, I don't understand. I fully believe that we can build up women without having to tear down men. And I don't understand why we need to like, make men the villain here and why she can't have a love interest. Like, that's kind of the premise that so many of us grew up watching Disney is like falling for that fairy tale and wanting to fall in love.""

Amy Carlson wanted to be special. She tried astrology, and she tried men — angry, violent, useless men. One held a knife to her throat, which forced her to get a restraining order. One fathered her first child, but the relationship didn’t last. She married another man and gave birth to a daughter, and yet she was still restless. In 2005 she got divorced, and she delivered her last child, Aidan, the same year. That’s when she saw the archangel Michael. The great being was visible above Aidan’s crib, and he had a message for her alone. “It’s time,” he told her, and then he disappeared.

When Carlson told this story much later, she said she had no time to ask the angel any questions. Instead she looked to the internet, writes journalist Leah Sottile in her new book, Blazing Eye Sees All: Love Has Won, False Prophets, and the Fever Dream of the American New Age. Carlson began posting on a website called lightworkers.org, where she claimed that her spiritual “guides” had informed her of her true mission on earth. “They are insisting that I move out of 3d completely and begin living fully in 5th dimension … I have been balancing both,” she wrote, adding that she wanted to stop living in an “illusion.” Carlson’s posts “read like they were written by two different Amys,” Sottile observes: One had a purpose, and the other cried in the shower. Carlson also said online that a disembodied voice told her that she would become president of the United States. “I am choosing to release all the pain and suffering of illusion and to step into my Magnificence, Beauty, and Greatness I am destined to Be,” she posted. Then, during a family dinner at a Mexican restaurant, she stood up and said she had to go. “I didn’t think she’d just leave and never come back,” her sister told Sottile, but that’s exactly what she did.

Leaving the illusion meant leaving her job managing a McDonald’s, her children, and her life, but never the internet. She liked to post videos of the Crestone, Colorado, home she shared with her new “twin flame,” Amerith WhiteEagle; Sottile writes that she soon began signing off as “Mother God.” WhiteEagle was Father God for a while, and after they split she kept posting, splicing cryptic decrees with wonder tales. She told viewers that she’d lived hundreds of lives and had inhabited the mythical continent of Lemuria before it sank into the sea. “The Entire [9/11] truth, as well as The UFO Conspiracy Cover~Up, Must Be Revealed immediately,” she said in one typical pronouncement. Offline, she collected new Father Gods and new followers, and they became a small but loyal congregation. The group launched a website called Love Has Won, which proclaimed her the Mother of All Creation and offered “psychic surgeries,” though it would become clear that it was Carlson who needed help. By 2020, she was sick, and soon she lost the ability to walk. Her skin turned blue from the daily consumption of colloidal silver, and she lost so much weight that “her collarbones stuck out from her body like razors,” Sottile writes. Her followers refused to get her medical help when she asked for it.

On April 28, 2021, Crestone police entered the Love Has Won home, where they discovered her followers, a bed strewn with twinkle lights, and, on the bed, a slight lump. Carlson’s body was “swaddled in an REI sleeping bag,” Sottile writes, her skin “sparkled,” and her eyelids were painted with brightly colored blue and green glitter. “Mother God had been mummified,” Sottile reports. Elsewhere in the house, someone had taped up an image of Carlson’s head photoshopped onto the body of Jesus and above it wrote one name: “Aidan.”

A lot of mothers cry in the shower, as Carlson did, and most don’t abandon their children. Maybe she was in psychosis, but that explanation is unsatisfactory. It’s no stranger to hear angels than it is to listen, as many Christians do, for the still small voice of God. Maybe she invented her visions to control her flock, but we can’t get inside her head. Instead Sottile links Carlson to old and often reactionary ideas that are gaining new traction. New Age spirituality has always been a vehicle for the radical, but in the Trump era, the fringe is no longer so obscure. Some New Age women are spreading pseudoscience and far-right views while coalescing around Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his master, Trump — just as Carlson did before she died. Her earthly works and ultimate fate are revelatory, if not the way she intended. Like men, women desire meaning and value, even power. She wanted authority, and a version of motherhood on her own terms, and it consumed her.

Christians believed for centuries that palms bled, saints levitated, and visionaries walked the earth. A woman could transcend her sexual status — and with it, motherhood — and achieve some authority through extraordinary spirituality. Before Mary of Egypt flew and frightened the monk Zosimus, she renounced her carnal proclivities for the solitude of the desert. Margery Kempe, the English mystic, said that she would rather “have eaten and drunk the ooze and muck in the gutter” than have sex with her husband. She suffered through 14 pregnancies before he agreed to a celibate marriage, which allowed her to roam medieval Europe on pilgrimage. But Kempe was an exception: Women who stepped out of place could expect to be punished. Sottile recalls the legend of Pope Joan, who dressed as a man so she could be educated and rose through the ranks of the church before she “quite suddenly dropped to the ground and gave birth to a child.” In one version of the story, the faithful stone her to death for her sins.

Women may have stopped flying, but they still needed miracles. Sottile writes that in the Victorian era, women could transcend their inferior status by channeling spirits. “Spiritualism and women’s rights were intertwined,” she adds, sometimes in dramatic fashion. At the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, “strange rappings” would shake “the very table where suffragists Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote the Declaration of Sentiments,” Sottile notes. When Helena Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society a few decades later, she positioned herself as the chief spiritual authority of a new religious movement. She was an odd figure who’d fled her much older husband in a search for esoteric truth, and her tales bore a touch of the grandiose: She spoke of ascended masters, and ancient wisdom, and a great spiritual destiny for herself. Yet her philosophy was little more than a mishmash of Hindu, Buddhist, and Spiritualist thought, and though she empowered herself, she reinforced rather than subverted the convictions of her time. In 1888, she published The Secret Doctrine, which identified Lemuria as the origin of the “most superior” Aryan “root-race.”

Her belief in white supremacy was not unusual for the era, though as Sottile points out, “there’s simply no way to see the idea of Aryans as a superior race as not racist.” She was also a proven fraud. Nevertheless, her ideas “laid the foundation for so many New Age practitioners to come,” Sottile argues, adding that New Age ideas attracted thousands of women in the 1970s and 1980s — just as Spiritualism did in the 19th century and often for the same reasons. Suffrage extended certain political rights to women, but it didn’t change the fact that most Protestant denominations would not ordain them and Catholic women could not become priests. In a country dominated by Christianity, many women found that their limited church roles mirrored their legal and sexual restrictions, but New Age thought “offered a true spiritual alternative — a path that prized personal insight over the entrenched ideas of spiritual leaders,” Sottile writes. New Age women searched for power within the self.

Who can blame them? Why be Kempe, who said she forced herself to have sex with her husband, if a woman can be Mother God and have sex with whoever she wants? But Mother God freed no one, not even herself. She ruled her fiefdom with all the sensitivity of the common patriarch. In Sottile’s account, Carlson drank all day and berated her followers until she died. She’s not alone, either.

By 2011, Sottile writes, the nexus of conspiracy and New Age belief had become so pronounced that experts coined a term for it. “Conspirituality” thrives on social media, and the rise of Trump has only supercharged it. Many of its most prominent voices are women like Carlson, who listen to their inner voices to the exclusion of all others, and they tilt, often, to the far right. A disdain for expertise and the quest for bodily purity has fused with New Age pseudoscience, as Sottile documents: When COVID struck, the New Age legend J.Z. Knight posted anti-vaccine signs on the gates of her compound. And Blavatsky’s mystical race science hardly disappeared with her death. Knight, an erstwhile rodeo queen who says she can channel a 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, despises Jews and Mexicans alike.

Not only did Carlson say that she had been Blavatsky in a prior life, she put her own slant on the notion of Aryan superiority. A man who knew Carlson and her group during their sojourn in Dunsmuir, California, told Sottile that he was drawn in by her antisemitism, though he said that her prejudice “wasn’t as deep” as his own. Sottile later writes that in one video, the last Father God “repeatedly used a racial slur for Black people,” and the group’s livestreams “constantly called back to their beliefs in ‘the cabal,’” a common antisemitic trope. Trump “is a massive part of this plan, he’s a part of the divine mission,” a member said at one point, and Carlson told everyone the president had been her father when she lived in Lemuria. Followers read “Q updates” on air.

The self is not boundless, and a woman who delves within her own mind can trap herself there. Carlson was born in 1975, amid consciousness-raising and the International Women’s Year, but she was no more liberated than Kempe. She was a prisoner of herself. She could not conceive of a life without hierarchy, ordered by race and by gender. Her sacred motherhood only remade the traditional family in her own image, and she was the power, the violent heart of it all. She could give the orders, and she could cast her children out. Love Has Won became as authoritarian as its mother. A convert who Sottile calls Ben spent two days with the group before they gave him a drink that may have been drugged and told him to start walking into the Colorado wilderness. A local resident found him naked and dehydrated and drove him to the hospital. Carlson’s whims could be petty, too. When a former Father God failed to make her the dinner she requested, she whined. “My vision was chicken parmesan,” she told him. “I didn’t say meatballs. I love meatballs. But I didn’t fucking say that! Chicken. Parmesan.”

Toward the end of Blazing Eye, Sottile speaks to Carlson’s eldest son, Cole, who observes, “In my head I really don’t see that huge of a difference between the megachurch I used to have to go to and Amy’s cult. It’s just a matter of magnitude, acceptance, and success.” The director of an HBO docuseries on Love Has Won told W magazine that the group owed its popularity to a broken health-care system, a characterization Sottile disputes. “It overlooked that Love Has Won was based on a legacy of belief in America, and thrived from a structure in this country that allows people to lie if they say it’s in the name of their God,” she writes. Carlson and her spiritual predecessors “became enlightened on their own terms, then they offered that enlightenment as a product.”

Now that Carlson is gone — ascended, in the words of her loyalists — only the lie remains. Conspirituality is everywhere. In America you can believe anything, and you can sell just about anything, too. “For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; but then shall I know, even as also I am known,” the apostle Paul told the Corinthians. We are all Paul by our mirrors, looking for the truth, wanting to be seen. But the glass is cracking. Behind it there’s only a wall.

GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke is a Donald Trump loyalist.

Yet even the former Trump Cabinet secretary isn’t currently willing to go along with party leaders’ plans to muscle the president’s deficit-busting agenda through Congress with hardly any attempt to pay for it.

Zinke, a Montana congressman who served as interior secretary in Trump’s first term, was among multiple Republicans privately raising doubts about the Senate’s budget plan in a tense GOP meeting Tuesday morning, voicing concerns about passing pricey tax cuts with only $4 billion in spending reductions — all while raising the nation’s borrowing limit by another $5 trillion.

“The math doesn’t add up,” a frustrated Zinke told fellow Republicans, according to two people in the room.

Zinke is not alone, with at least a dozen House Republicans saying they were willing to reject the Senate’s budget plans despite the hard push from Trump himself, who is eager to show tangible progress on his agenda to battered financial markets as his big reciprocal tariffs take effect.

Their collision is the latest reminder that some Republicans on Capitol Hill who consider themselves “true believers” on fiscal conservatism are still adjusting to following a president who has never made battling the deficit a top priority.

GOP leaders believe that they will ultimately win over enough skeptics to adopt the Senate budget and take that key first step toward the White House’s agenda — punting the bigger fight until this summer. But the fate of the plan remains uncertain early Wednesday, even as House Speaker Mike Johnson plans to force the vote on the floor later in the day.

More than a half-dozen of these House fiscal hawks told CNN they’re not willing to abandon a core political mission that drove many of them to Congress in the first place: Taming the national debt before it tanks the US economy.

This gang of hardline fiscal hawks will be perhaps the most important bloc of votes for Trump and GOP leaders this year. One senior GOP aide said many of the members see themselves on a “divine mission” — and so are unafraid to buck their own leaders and president on the issue.

In an interview Tuesday afternoon, Zinke said he, of course, wants Trump to succeed but also said he and others aren’t willing to rubberstamp the costly plan without a serious push to get federal spending under control.

“We’ve kicked the can long enough,” Zinke told CNN.

Key Republicans insist it’s ‘right time’ to tackle spending

Since his reelection in November, Trump has successfully talked ultraconservative House Republicans into backing a number of difficult votes on spending. Many Republicans voted for their first debt limit increase or stopgap spending bill, at Trump’s request. But many of them stressed that the budget vote is different.

“I want to see something that is enforceable,” GOP Rep. Lloyd Smucker, the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, said in an interview Tuesday.

Smucker — who is opposed to the current Senate budget — is proof that the House’s most vocal fiscal hawks aren’t limited to the usual rabble-rousers in the House Freedom Caucus. And some of them have already stomached big spending increases during Trump’s first term, when Congress passed big increases in defense spending as well as the 2017 tax cuts.

As the vice chair of the House budget panel, Smucker has hardly ever threatened to oppose a party priority. But he said he has talked to “anyone who will listen,” including Johnson, about why he won’t accept a proposal that doesn’t promise real cuts.

“I want to be a productive member of the team. I love what the president is doing. I want to support him. I think he can be the one to have the legacy of changing our fiscal state. And I think this is the right time to begin to do that,” Smucker told CNN about why he is currently opposed to the Senate’s budget blueprint, despite pressure from his party.

And even as some GOP leaders stress they need to reassure the markets of Trump’s plans, Smucker said it’s more important to show that Congress won’t simply rack up more spending: “I would be concerned about sending a signal to the markets that neither party cares at all about the debt.”

‘Trump doesn’t control the Senate’

So far, GOP leaders and Trump are focusing their pressure campaign on members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, who have made up some of the fiercest resistance to the Senate plans.

Trump hosted a group of those conservatives at the White House on Tuesday afternoon where they sat, alongside Speaker Mike Johnson, to talk about how to move forward. That came after a Monday night Freedom Caucus meeting in which Johnson personally sat at the table to talk about the plan.

Following the meeting, Trump urged House Republican members opposing his plans to “stop grandstanding” at a speech during a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the president pushed his party to unite to pass the Senate-passed budget resolution this week.

“We had a great meeting today,” Trump said. “I think we are there. But just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just gotta get there. Close your eyes and get there, it’s a phenomenal bill … just stop grandstanding.”

But House hardliners have raised major alarms at changes made by the Senate GOP, pointing to how senators watered down provisions seeking deeper spending cuts. Johnson can only afford to lose three House GOP votes and far more are warning they plan to oppose the plan — including Rep. Chip Roy, despite attending that White House meeting with Trump.

“We have to take what’s in front of us, and we have to do the math and decide whether or not that’s going to produce deficits that are bigger or smaller,” Roy told CNN after returning from the White House. “All I see are promises. I do not believe in promises in Washington. … The Senate has sent a bill to us that doesn’t add up.”

One of his fellow Freedom Caucus conservatives, Rep. Eli Crane, was even more blunt, telling CNN’s Manu Raju he’s “leaning” no on the Senate plan, calling it “pathetic” and “a joke.”

The Arizona Republican said only “serious cuts” could get him to a yes, and asked if assurances from Trump could get him to back it, he answered, “Unfortunately, you know, President Trump doesn’t control the Senate.”

Both Roy and Crane backed the House GOP’s earlier budget plan, which called for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts — despite their own hesitations about backing a policy to raise the debt limit.

One of the authors of that spending cuts plan is GOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who initially pushed for as much as $8 trillion in cuts as part of Trump’s legislative package.

Now, as he’s asked to swallow just $4 billion in cuts instead, Norman said he’s willing to walk away with nothing, rather than risk a deficit-busting bill.

“I will go home. If we’re gonna play the games like we’re playing, then what’s the use? I’m not playing. I’ll go home,” Norman told CNN.

That same red line applies to even Trump’s personal policy demands, such as even more tax hikes beyond what was in his 2017 bill.

“If you cut taxes for Social Security, tips — which the president wants — it’s got a price tag,” Norman said. “This stuff is real serious.”

Delegations from Japan and South Korea are en route. Italy’s prime minister will be in Washington next week. And Israel’s “proactive approach” to seeking out new US trade agreements could serve as a model for everyone, according to the White House.

A day before President Donald Trump’s new worldwide tariffs are set to take hold, the White House made clear Tuesday the door for new trade negotiations was wide open — even if the exact formula for earning relief from the duties remained unclear.

“These countries are calling us up. Kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” Trump told a group of Republicans on Tuesday evening, hours before the tariffs were set to take hold. He described foreign leaders essentially groveling to avoid the new tariffs: “Please, please sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything sir.”

As countries scramble to respond to Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements last week, many are receiving advice from US diplomats and sources close to the White House encouraging them to think creatively, beyond the scope of trade, as they prepare to negotiate with the White House.

Their message to foreign counterparts seems simple: If they have a unique card to play, they should.

Ideas being discussed run the gamut, and include possible action on securing the freedom of Americans wrongfully detained abroad, committing to working with US artificial intelligence companies, buying more US energy or combatting global drug trafficking, according to five people familiar with the brainstorming sessions.

After days of mixed signals over how willing the president would be to negotiate tariff relief, Tuesday’s message was far clearer: Trump is ready for opening bids.

“The phones have been ringing off the hook, wanting to talk to this administration, this president and his trade team to try to strike a deal,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said midday.

It’s not just foreign leaders who have been calling. As the tariff deadline neared this week, the chief executives of some of the largest multinational companies — who have been loathe to criticize Trump’s tariffs publicly — nonetheless maintained a robust backchannel to the White House.

An onslaught of CEOs from banking, technology, and industrial companies – among others – have been lighting up the phone lines of chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, several executives told CNN, to argue the tariff policy will harm the global economy and credibility of American business and government. The recent effort was described by one CEO close to the White House as a “tsunami” in recent days.

Trump endorsed the shift in message toward more dealmaking – and notably, messengers – after becoming frustrated by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s television appearances, which seemed to fuel the market’s meltdown, several executives familiar with the discussions told CNN. The shift also came after aides warned Trump that the damage sustained in the market would endanger him politically, those people told CNN.

Wiles, those executives added, had been particularly effective in convincing Trump that the market rout was costing considerable political capital that he would need for future agenda items, with lawmakers fielding increasingly angry constituent calls as the market continued sinking.

“There are voices in the White House that want high tariffs forever. There are angels and demons sitting on President Trump’s shoulders,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posted on X. “Who does he listen to? I hope he listens to the angels.”

After days of criticism from some of his closest allies over his tariff strategy, Trump on Tuesday made clear he was confident in his decisions.

“I know what the hell I’m doing,” he told the GOP crowd.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CNN that “the administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans,” adding that “the only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making, however, is the best interest of the American people.”

Desai added: “The entire Trump administration is playing from the same playbook – President Trump’s playbook – to level the playing field for our industries and workers, and Secretary Lutnick continues to be one of the administration’s most effective TV communicators for that playbook.”

Seeking deals that go beyond tariffs and trade barriers

But what precisely the president is looking for from his foreign interlocutors will vary by nation, White House officials said. It seemed certain the contours of his new trade deals would extend well beyond tariffs and trade barriers to other areas, including US military presence and foreign aid.

Trump described the approach Tuesday as “one-stop shopping”: using the threat of withering tariffs as leverage on any manner of issues arising between the United States and its partners.

“A beautiful and efficient process!!!” he wrote online.

In some cases, the White House is working with the State Department on preparing lists of actions that countries could take, according to one US official.

That is the case with China, where one idea on the table is for President Xi Jinping to make a public pronouncement that Chinese companies should stop producing fentanyl precursor chemicals, which could be an effective step in reining in the global drug war, an issue that Trump has prioritized.

There is no expectation that an offer completely devoid of trade or tariff action will spur movement, particularly because Trump himself has said that this is the “only chance” for the US to “re-set the table” on trade. But sources involved in the current discussions expect offers that couple action on trade plus something else to sweeten the deal could be effective.

Trump’s advisers hope to have results soon that can demonstrate the success of his tariff plan, which has generated deep concern even among his closest allies and sent markets reeling earlier this week.

Trump, too, is eagerly watching as his global counterparts seek him out in the hopes he’ll lift his tariffs, relishing his role as the ultimate decider on what — and who — gets a reprieve, depending on what they’re offering.

“I call them tailored, not off the rack,” Trump said of the nascent agreements his team is now entertaining with as many as 70 countries that have approached the administration to talk trade.

The logistics of arbitrating dozens of new bilateral agreements did not seem lost on the president, who suggested he may conscript lawyers at the large law firms he’s targeted for retribution to help him write up the terms.

“We need a lot of talent. We have a lot of countries coming that want to make deals,” he said in the East Room, where he was discussing a new energy initiative surrounded by coal workers in hard hats. “Our problem is [we] can’t see that many that fast,” he said of the countries reaching out.

For that reason, there appeared little hope for an eleventh-hour cancelation of the new duties that are set to take effect at midnight. For as keen as Trump and his team are to secure new agreements that can be trumpeted as examples of the tariffs’ success, advisers expressed doubt they could be struck in only a day’s time, even for a president in a hurry.

And for as enthusiastic as many foreign leaders appeared to be to hop on an airplane or pick up the phone, the world’s second-largest economy proved a tougher case.

“China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started,” Trump wrote on social media. “We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

It hadn’t happened by the time US markets closed Tuesday. After posting big gains earlier in the day, the S&P 500 slumped again in late-day trading when it became clear Trump was plowing ahead with the new tariffs, including an extraordinary 104% tariff on China that will take effect a minute past midnight.

Trump has spent the last four years brooding about the shortcomings of the trade agreements he signed with China during his first administration. Beijing reneged on many of its promised purchases of American farm products, and Chinese duties on US soybeans and corns caused agricultural exports to sink.

This time around, Trump is seeking out a bigger, better trade agreement, and hopes the massive tariffs applied on China will lure its leader, Xi Jinping, to the negotiating table. So far, however, Xi has resisted Trump’s pressure to submit, ratcheting up tit-for-tat tariffs that could have widespread consequences.

Continued mixed messages from the administration

Trump acknowledged the effect his tariffs were having on global stability in his remarks Tuesday.

“Sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit,” he said, describing his tariffs as “somewhat explosive.”

Just this week, the market has shifted based on the conflicting messages of the people around the president. On Sunday, Lutnick said any chance of Trump reversing, pausing, or diluting his tariffs would “absolutely not” happen. That stance spurred steep losses for global markets that positioned US markets to open at levels that represented a 20% drop from all-time highs reached in mid-February, the fastest drop of that magnitude in history.

Markets experienced a slight bounce on Monday when National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett sidestepped a question over whether Trump would consider a 90-day pause – leading to false interpretations that Trump was, in fact, open to such a move.

By Tuesday, though, Bessent was front and center, attempting to reset the White House’s message that the tariffs were a means to a negotiated end.

But as early deliberations are now underway among nations looking to strike a deal, some countries say they are still receiving mixed messages from different corners of the administration.

In recent days, Lutnick told Japanese officials that making commitments on a possible future 800-mile pipeline facilitating transport of US natural gas to Asia more quickly – which has been referenced as a possible Alaska pipeline – would not be meaningful in these conversations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.

The Alaska pipeline is a project Trump has supported and has urged Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to partake in. And on Tuesday morning, Bessent, who has been tapped to lead the tariff talks with Japan, publicly spoke about the Alaska pipeline as a ripe topic to include in the negotiations.

“We will see what our trading partners offer. For instance there is talk of a big energy deal in Alaska where the Japanese, and perhaps the Koreans, perhaps the Taiwanese, would provide – would take a lot of the offtake – and provide financing for the deal,” Bessent said on CNBC. “That could be an alternative for them to come forward with that because not only would that provide a lot of American jobs, it would narrow the trade deficit.”

The confusion over what to include and what not to include underscores a concern among some former Trump administration officials that negotiating without a clear end game could become messy and unproductive.

“The president always wants the same thing in any negotiation: more,” said a former administration official.

“Even if the president was willing to discuss compromises, his differing rationales for the tariffs could conflict with one another and raise a question as to if he is even willing to negotiate.”
